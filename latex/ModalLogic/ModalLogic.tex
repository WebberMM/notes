\section{Basic Concepts}
\label{sec:org2071498}
\subsection{Modal Languages}
\label{sec:org5a3193d}
\begin{definition}[]
The \textbf{basic modal language} is defined using  a set of \textbf{proposition letters} \(\Phi\)
whose elements are usually denoted \(p,q,r\) and so on, and a unary modal
operator \(\lozenge\). The well-formed \textbf{formulas} \(\phi\) of the basic modal
language are given by the rule
\begin{equation*}
\phi:=p\mid\bot\mid\neg\phi\mid\psi\vee\phi\mid\lozenge\phi
\end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\(\fM,w\Vdash\phi\)
\begin{definition}[]
A \textbf{modal similarity type} is a pair \(\tau=(O,\rho)\) where \(O\) is a non-empty
set, and \(\rho\) is a function \(O\to\N\). The elements of \(O\) are called \textbf{modal
operators}; we use \(\triangle\), \(\triangle_0,\triangle_1,\dots\) to denote
elements of \(O\). The function \(\rho\) assigns to each operator \(\delta\in O\) a
finite \textbf{arity}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[]
  A \textbf{modal language} \(ML(\tau,\Phi)\
  ) is built up using a modal similarity type
\(\tau=(O,\rho)\) and a set of proposition letters \(\Phi\). The set \(Form(\tau,\Phi)\) of
\textbf{modal formulas} over \(\tau\) and \(\Phi\) is given by the rule
\begin{equation*}
\phi:=p\mid\bot\mid\neg\phi\mid\phi_1\vee\phi_2\mid\triangle(\phi_1,\dots,\phi_{\rho(\triangle)})
\end{equation*}
where \(p\) ranges over elements of \(\Phi\)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[]
For each \(\triangle\in O\) the \textbf{dual} \(\triangledown\) of \(\triangle\) is defined
as \(\triangledown(\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n):=\neg\triangle(\neg\phi_1,\dots,\neg\phi_n)\)
\end{definition}

\begin{examplle}[The Basic Temporal Language]
The basic temporal language is built using a set of unary operators \(O=\{\la
   F\ra,\la P\ra\}\). The intended interpretation of a formula \(\la F\ra\phi\)
is ' \(\phi\) will be true at some Future time' and the intended interpretation of
\(\la P\ra\phi\) is ' \(\phi\) was true at some Past time.' This language is called
the \textbf{basic temporal language}. Their duals are written as \(G\) and \(H\) ('it
is Going to be the case' and 'it always Has been the case')

Let's denote the converse of a relation \(R\) by \(R^\smallsmile\). We will
call a frame of the form \((T,R,R^\smallsmile)\) a \textbf{bidirectional frame}, and a
model built over such a frame a \textbf{bidirectional model}. From now on, we will
only interpret basic temporal language in bidirectional models. That is, if
\(\fM=(T,R,R^\smallsmile,V)\) is a bidirectional model then
\begin{align*}
\fM,t\Vdash F\phi \quad&\text{ iff }\quad
\exists s(Rts\wedge \fM,s\Vdash\phi)\\
\fM,t\Vdash P\phi \quad&\text{ iff }\quad
\exists s(R^\smallsmile ts\wedge \fM,s\Vdash\phi)
\end{align*}
\end{examplle}

\begin{examplle}[Propositional Dynamic Logic]
Each of these diamonds has the form \(\la\pi\ra\), where \(\pi\) denotes a
(non-deterministic) \textbf{program}. The intended interpretation of \(\la\pi\ra\) is
'some terminating execution of \(\pi\) from the present state leas to a state
bearing the information \(\phi\) '. The dual assertion \([\pi]\phi\) states that
'every execution of \(\pi\) from the present state leads to a state bearing the
information \(\phi\) '

Suppose we have fixed some set of basic programs \(a,b,c\) and so on. Then we
are allowed to define complex programs \(\pi\) over this base as follows
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Choice}. If \(\pi_1,\pi_2\) are programs, then so is \(\pi_1\cup\pi_2\)
\item \textbf{Composition}. so is \(\pi_1;\pi_2\)
\item \textbf{Iteration}. so is \(\pi^*\)
\end{enumerate}


This is called \textbf{regular} PDL. There are also
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Intersection} if \(\pi_1,\pi_2\) are programs, then so is
\(\pi_1\cap\pi_2\)

execute both \(\pi_1,\pi_2\), in parallel

\item \textbf{test} if \(\phi\) is a formula, then so is \(\phi?\)

test whether \(\phi\) holds, and if so, continues; if not, it fails
\end{enumerate}

The language of PDL has an infinite collection of diamonds, each indexed by a
program \(\pi\) build from basic programs using the constructor \(\cup,;\) and
\(^*\).
\begin{align*}
 &R_{\pi_1\cup\pi_2}=R_{\pi_1}\cup R_{\pi_2}\\
 &R_{\pi_1;\pi_2}=R_{\pi_1}\circ R_{\pi_2}\\
 &R_{\pi_1^*}=(R_{\pi_1})^*
 \end{align*}

Suppose  we have fixed a set of basic programs. Let \(\Pi\) be the set of programs
containing the basic programs and all the programs constructed over them
using the regular constructors \(\cup,;,^*\). Then a \textbf{regular frame for} \(\Pi\) is
a labeled transitive system \((W,\{R_\pi\mid\pi\in\Pi\})\) s..t \(R_a\) is an
arbitrary binary  relation for each basic program \(a\), and for all complex
programs \(\pi\), \(R_{\pi}\) is the binary relation inductively constructed in
accordance with the previous clauses. A \textbf{regular model} for \(\Pi\) is a model built
over a regular frame.
\end{examplle}

\begin{examplle}[An Arrow Language]
The type \(\tau_\to\) of \textbf{arrow logic} is a similarity type with modal
operators other than diamonds. The language of arrow logic is designed to
talk about the objects in arrow structures. The well-formed formulas \(\phi\) are
given by
\begin{equation*}
\phi:=p\mid\bot\mid\neg\phi\mid\phi\vee\psi\mid\phi\circ\psi\mid
\otimes\phi\mid 1'
\end{equation*}
1' ('identity') is a nullary modality, the 'converse' operator \(\otimes\) is
a diamond, and the 'composition' operator \(\circ\) is a dyadic operator.
Possible readings of these operators are:
\begin{alignat*}{3}
&1'&&\text{identity}&&\text{'skip'}\\
&\otimes\phi&&\text{converse}&&\text{'\(\phi\) conversely'}\\
&\phi\circ\psi\quad&&\text{composition}\quad&&\text{'first \(\phi\), then \(\psi\)'}
\end{alignat*}
\end{examplle}
\subsection{Models and Frames}
\label{sec:org53148cd}
\begin{definition}[]
A \textbf{frame} for the basic modal language is a pair \(\fF=(W,R)\) s.t.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(W\) is a non-empty set
\item \(R\) is a binary relation on \(W\)
\end{enumerate}


A \textbf{model} for the basic modal language is a pair \(\fM=(\fF,V)\), where \(\fF\)
is a frame for the basic modal language and \(V\) is a function assigning to
each proposition letter \(p\) in \(\Phi\) a subset \(V(p)\) of \(W\). The function
\(V\) is called a \textbf{valuation}. \(\fM\) is \textbf{based on} the frame \(\fF\)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[]
Suppose \(w\) is a state in a model \(\fM=(W,R,V)\). Then \(\phi\) is \textbf{satisfied} in
\(\fM\) at state \(w\) if
\begin{align*}
\fM,w\Vdash p&\quad\text{iff}\quad
w\in V(p),\text{ where } p\in\Phi\\
\fM,w\Vdash\bot&\quad\text{iff}\quad\text{never}\\
\fM,w\Vdash\neg\phi&\quad\text{iff}\quad
\text{not }\fM,w\Vdash\phi\\
\fM,w\Vdash\phi\vee\psi&\quad\text{iff}\quad
\fM,w\Vdash\phi\text{ or }\fM,w\Vdash\psi\\
\fM,w\Vdash\lozenge\phi&\quad\text{iff}\quad
\text{ for some }v\in W\text{ with }Rwv\text{ we have }\fM,v\Vdash\phi
\end{align*}
It follows that \(\fM,w\Vdash\Box\phi\) iff for all \(v\in W\) s.t.
\(Rwv\), we have \(\fM,v\Vdash\phi\)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type. A \textbf{\(\tau\)-frame} is a tuple \(\fF\)
consisting of the following ingredients
\begin{enumerate}
\item a non-empty set \(W\)
\item for each \(n\ge0\), and each \(n\)-ary modal operator \(\triangle\) in the
similarity type \(\tau\), an \((n+1)\)-ary relation \(R_{\triangle}\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\(\phi\) is \textbf{satisfied at a state \(w\)} in a model
\(\fM=(W,\{R_{\triangle}\mid\triangle\in\tau\},V)\) when
\(\rho(\triangle)\iffalse<\fi>0\) if
\begin{align*}
\fM,w\Vdash\triangle(\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n)\quad\text{iff}\quad&
\text{for some }v_1,\dots,v_n\in W\text{ with } R_{\triangle} wv_1\dots v_n\\
&\text{we have, for each }i,\fM,v_i\Vdash\phi_i
\end{align*}

When \(\rho(\triangle)=0\) we define
\begin{equation*}
\fM,w\Vdash\triangle \quad\text{ iff }\quad
w\in R_{\triangle}
\end{equation*}

\begin{definition}[]
The set of all formulas that are valid in a class of frames \(\sfF\)is called
the \textbf{logic} of \(\sfF\) (notation: \(\Lambda_{\sfF}\))
\end{definition}

\subsection{General Frames}
\label{sec:orgc9a635b}
\begin{definition}[]
Given an \((n+1)\)-ary relation \(R\) on a set \(W\), we define the following
\(n\)-ary operation \(m_R\) on the power set \(\calp(W)\) of \(W\):
\begin{equation*}
m_R(X_1,\dots,X_n)=\{w\in W\mid Rww_1\dots w_n\text{ for some }
w_1\in X_1,\dots,w_n\in X_n\}
\end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\section{Models}
\label{sec:orgfdebf86}
\subsection{Invariance Results}
\label{sec:orgd81e6b6}
\begin{definition}[]
Let \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\) be models of the same modal similarity type \(\tau\), and
let \(w\) and \(w'\) be states in \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\) respectively. The
\textbf{\(\tau\)-theory} (or \textbf{\(\tau\)-type}) \textbf{of} \(w\) is the set of all
\(\tau\)-formulas satisfied at \(w\): that is,
\(\{\phi\mid\fM,w\Vdash\phi\}\). We say that \(w\) and \(w'\) are \textbf{(modally)
equivalent} (\(w\leftrightsquigarrow w'\)) if they have the same \(\tau\)-theories

The \textbf{\(\tau\)-theory} of the model \(\fM\) is the set of all \(\tau\)-formulas
satisfied by all states in \(fM\); that is, \(\{\phi\mid\fM\Vdash\phi\}\)
Models \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\) are called
\textbf{(modally) equivalent} (\(\fM\leftrightsquigarrow\fM'\)) if their theories are identical
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Disjoint Unions}
\label{sec:orgd3f5806}
\subsubsection{Generated submodels}
\label{sec:org8feb074}
\begin{definition}[]
Let \(\fM=(W,R,V)\) and \(\fM'=(W',R',V')\) be two models; we say that
\(\fM'\) is a \textbf{submodel} of \(\fM\) if \(W'\subseteq W\), \(R'\) is the
restriction of \(R\) to \(W'\), and \(V'\) is the restriction of \(V\) to
\(\fM'\). We say that \(\fM'\) is a \textbf{generated submodel} of \(\fM\)
(\(\fM'\rightarrowtail\fM\)) if \(\fM'\) is a submodel of \(\fM\) and for
all points \(w\) the following closure condition holds
\begin{equation*}
\text{if }w\text{ is in }\fM'\text{ and }Rwv,\text{ then }v\text{ is in }\fM'
\end{equation*}

Let \(fM\) be a model, and \(X\) a subset of the domain of \(\fM\); the
\textbf{submodel generated by} \(X\) is the smallest generated submodel of \(\fM\)
whose domain contains \(X\). A \textbf{rooted} or \textbf{point generated} model is a model
that is generated by a singleton set, the element of which is called the
\textbf{root} of the frame
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Morphism for modalities}
\label{sec:orgb79beec}
\begin{definition}[Homomorphisms]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type and let \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\) be
\(\tau\)-models. By a \textbf{homomorphism} \(f:\fM\to\fM'\), we mean a function \(f:W\to
    W'\) satisfying
\begin{enumerate}
\item For each proposition letter \(p\) and each element \(w\) from \(\fM\), if
\(w\in V(p)\), then \(f(w)\in V'(p)\)
\item For each \(n\ge0\) and each \(n\)-ary \(\triangle\in\tau\) and
\((n+1)\)-tuple \(\bbar{w}\) from \(\fM\), if \((w_0,\dots,w_n)\in
       R_{\triangle}\), then \((f(w_0),\dots,f(w_n))\in R_{\triangle}'\) (the
\textbf{homomorphic condition})
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Strong Homomorphisms, Embeddings and Isomorphisms]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type and let \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\) be
\(\tau\)-models. By a \textbf{strong homomorphism} \(f:\fM\to\fM'\), we mean a function \(f:W\to
    W'\) satisfying
\begin{enumerate}
\item For each proposition letter \(p\) and each element \(w\) from \(\fM\) iff
\(w\in V(p)\), then \(f(w)\in V'(p)\)
\item For each \(n\ge0\) and each \(n\)-ary \(\triangle\in\tau\) and
\((n+1)\)-tuple \(\bbar{w}\) from \(\fM\) iff \((w_0,\dots,w_n)\in
       R_{\triangle}\), iff \((f(w_0),\dots,f(w_n))\in R_{\triangle}'\) (the
\textbf{strong homomorphic condition})
\end{enumerate}


An \textbf{embedding} of \(\fM\) into \(\fM'\) is a strong homomorphism
\(f:\fM\to\fM'\) which is injective. An \textbf{isomorphism} is a bijective strong homomorphism
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type and let \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\) be
\(\tau\)-models. Then the following holds
\begin{enumerate}
\item for all elements \(w\) and \(w'\) of \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\), respectively,
if there exists a surjective strong homomorphism \(f:\fM\to\fM'\) with
\(f(w)=w'\), then \(w\) and \(w\) are modally equivalent
\item If \(\fM\cong\fM'\), then \(\fM\leftrightsquigarrow\fM'\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}[Bounded Morphisms - the Basic Case]
Let \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\) be models for the basic modal language. A mapping
\(f:\fM=(W,R,V)\to\fM'=(W',R',V')\) is a \textbf{bounded morphsim} if it satisfies
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(w\) and \(f(w)\) satisfy the same proposition letters
\item \(f\) is a homomorphism w.r.t. the relation \(R\) (if \(Rwv\) then \(R'f(w)f(v)\))
\item If \(R'f(w)v'\) then there exists \(v\) s.t. \(Rwv\) and \(f(v)=v'\) (the
\textbf{back condition})
\end{enumerate}


If there is a \textbf{surjective} bounded morphism from \(\fM\) to \(\fM'\), then we
say that \(\fM'\) is a \textbf{bounded morphic image} of \(\fM\), and write
\(\fM\twoheadrightarrow\fM'\)
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type and let \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\) be
\(\tau\)-models s.t. \(f:\fM\to\fM'\) is a bounded morphism. Then for each
modal formula \(\phi\), and each element \(w\) of \(\fM\) we have
\(\fM,w\Vdash\phi\) iff \(\fM',f(w)\Vdash\phi\).
\end{proposition}


Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type containing only diamonds (thus if \(\fM\)
is a \(\tau\)-model, it has the form \((W,R_1,\dots,V)\) where each \(R_i\)
is a binary relation on \(W\)) . In this context we will call a
\(\tau\)-model \(\fM\) \textbf{tree-like} if the structure \((W,\bigcup_i R_i,V)\) is
a tree

\begin{proposition}[]
\label{prop2.15}
Assume that \(\tau\) is a modal similarity type containing only diamonds. Then for
any rooted \(\tau\)-models \(\fM\) there exists a tree-like \(\tau\)-models
\(\fM'\) s.t. \(\fM'\twoheadrightarrow\fM\). Hence any satisfiable
\(\tau\)-formula is satisfiable in a tree-like model
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let \(w\) be the root of \(\fM\). Define the model \(\fM'\) as follows. Its
domain \(W'\) consist of all finite sequences \((w,u_1,\dots,u_n)\) s.t.
\(n\ge0\) and for some modal operators \(\la a_1\ra,\dots,\la
    a_n\ra\in\tau\) there is a path \(wR_{a_1}u_1\cdots R_{a_n}u_n\) in \(\fM\).
Define \((w,u_1,\dots,u_n)R'_a(w,v_1,\dots,w_m)\) to hold if
\(m=n+1,u_i=v_i\) for \(i=1,\dots,n\) and \(R_au_nv_m\) holds in \(\fM\).
That is, \(R'_a\) relates two sequences iff the second is an extension of
the first with a state from \(\fM\) that is a sucessor of the last element
of the first sequence. Finally, \(V'\) is defined by putting
\((w,u_1,\dots,u_n)\in V'(p)\) iff \(u_n\in V(p)\). The mapping
\(f:(w,u_1,\dots,u_n)\mapsto u_n\) defines a surjective bounded morphism
from \(\fM'\) to \(\fM\)
\end{proof}




\subsection{Bisimulations}
\label{sec:org51df775}
\begin{definition}[Bisimulation - the Basic Case]
\label{def2.16}
Let \(\fM=(W,R,V)\) and \(\fM=(W',R',V')\) be two models

A non-empty binary relation \(Z\subseteq W\times W'\) is called a \textbf{bisimulation
between} \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\) (notation: \(Z:\fM\leftrightarroweq\fM')\) if
\begin{enumerate}
\item If \(wZw'\) then \(w\) and \(w'\) satisfy the same proposition letters
\item If \(wZw'\) and \(Rwv\), then there exists \(v'\) (in \(\fM'\)) s.t.
\(vZv'\) and \(R'w'v'\) (the \textbf{forth condition})
\item The converse of (2): if \(wZw'\) and \(R'w'v'\), then there exists \(v\)
(in \(\fM\)) s.t. \(vZv'\) and \(Rwv\) (the \textbf{back condition})
\end{enumerate}


When \(Z\) is a bisimulation linking two states \(w\) in \(\fM\) and \(w'\)
in \(\fM'\) we say that \(w\) and \(w'\) are \textbf{bisimilar}, and we write
\(Z:\fM,w\leftrightarroweq \fM',w'\). If there is a bisimulation, we sometimes
write \(\fM,w\leftrightarroweq \fM',w'\) or \(w\leftrightarroweq w'\)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Bisimulation - the General Case]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, and let
\(\fM=(W,R_{\triangle},V)_{\triangle\in\tau}\) and
\(\fM'=(W',R_{\triangle}',V')_{\triangle\in\tau}\) be \(\tau\)-models. A
non-empty binary relation \(Z\subseteq W\times W'\) is called a \textbf{bisimulation}
between \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\) (\(Z:\fM\leftrightarroweq\fM'\)) if the above
condition 1 is satisfied and
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item If \(wZw'\) and \(R_{\triangle}wv_1\dots v_n\) then there are
\(v_1',\dots,v_n'\in W'\) s.t. \(R'_{\triangle}w'v_1'\dots v_n'\) and for
all \(i\) (\(1\le i\le n\)) \(v_iZv_i'\) (the \textbf{forth} condition)
\item If \(wZw'\) and \(R'_{\triangle}w'v_1'\dots v_n'\) then there are
\(v_1,\dots,v_n\in W\) s.t. \(R_{\triangle}wv_1\dots v_n\) and for
all \(i\) (\(1\le i\le n\)) \(v_iZv_i'\) (the \textbf{back} condition)
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, and let \(\fM,\fM'\) and \(\fM_i\) (\(i\in
   I\)) be \(\tau\)-models
\begin{enumerate}
\item If \(\fM\cong\fM'\), then \(\fM\leftrightarroweq\fM'\)
\item For every \(i\in I\), and every \(w\) in \(\fM_i\),
\(\fM_i,w\leftrightarroweq\biguplus_i\fM_i,w\)
\item If \(\fM'\rightarrowtail\fM\), then \(\fM',w\leftrightarroweq\fM,w\) for
all \(w\) in \(\fM'\)
\item If \(f:\fM\twoheadrightarrow\fM'\), then
\(\fM,w\leftrightarroweq\fM',f(w)\) for all \(w\) in \(\fM\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Suppose \(\fM=(W,R_{\triangle},V)_{\triangle\in\tau}\) and
\(\fM'=(W',R_{\triangle}',V')_{\triangle\in\tau}\) 
\(\fM_i\subseteq \biguplus_i\fM_i\)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose \(f:\fM\cong\fM'\), then we define \(wZw'\) iff \(w'=f(w)\) where
\(w\in W,w'\in W'\). Bisimulation comes from the definition of the isomorphism
\item Define the relation \(Z=\{(w,w)\mid
      w\in\fM_i\}\subseteq\fM_i\times\biguplus\fM_i\). The first condition comes
from the invariance. The forth condition is obvious. For the back
condition, if \(R_{\triangle}'w'v_1'\dots v_n'\) and \(w'\in W\), then
\(v_1',\dots,v_n'\in W\) since each \(R_{\triangle,i}\) is disjoint and we
have \(R_{\triangle,i}w'v_1'\dots v_n'\)
\item Define the relation \(Z=\{(w,w)\mid w\in\fM'\}\subseteq\fM'\times\fM\).
The first condition comes from the invariance. Forth condition is obvious.
For the back condition, suppose \(wZw\) and \(R'_{\triangle}wv_1'\dots
      v_n'\), by the definition, \(v_1',\dots,v_n'\in W\) and
\(R_{\triangle}wv_1'\dots v_n'\)
\item Define \(Z=\{(w,f(w)\mid w\in W)\}\). The first condition comes from the
definition. If \(wZw'\) and \(R_{\triangle}wv_1\dots v_n\), then
\(R'_{\triangle}f(w)f(v_1)\dots f(v_n)\). If \(wZw'\) and
\(R_{\triangle}'w'v_1'\dots v_n\), then there is \(v_1,\dots,v_n\) s.t.
\(R_{\triangle}wv_1,\dots,v_n\) and \(f(v_i)=v_i'\) for \(1\le i\le n\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[]
\label{thm2.20}
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, and let \(\fM, \fM'\) be \(\tau\)-models.
Then, for every \(w\in W\) and \(w'\in W'\), \(w\leftrightarroweq w'\)
implies that \(w\leftrightsquigarrow w'\). In other words, modal formulas are
invariant under bisimulation
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Induction on the complexity of \(\phi\).

Suppose \(\phi\) is \(\diamond\psi\), we have \(\fM,w\Vdash\diamond\psi\) iff there
exists a \(v\) in \(\fM\) s.t. \(Rwv\) and \(\fM,v\Vdash\psi\). As
\(w\leftrightarroweq w'\), there exists a \(v'\) in \(\fM'\) s.t. \(R'w'v'\)
and \(v\leftrightarroweq v'\). By the I.H., \(\fM',v'\Vdash\psi\), hence \(\fM',w'\Vdash\diamond\psi\)
\end{proof}

\(\fM\) is \textbf{image-finite} if for each state \(u\) in \(\fM\) and each relation
\(R\) in \(\fM\), the set \(\{(v_1,\dots,v_n)\mid Ruv_1\dots v_n\}\) is
finite

\begin{theorem}[Hennessy-Milner Theorem]
\label{thm2.24}
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type and let \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\) be two
image-finite \(\tau\)-models. Then for every \(w\in W\) and \(w'\in W'\),
\(w\leftrightarroweq w'\) iff \(w\leftrightsquigarrow w'\)
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Assume that our similarity type \(\tau\) only contains a single diamond. The
direction from left to right follows from Theorem \ref{thm2.20}

Suppose \(w\leftrightsquigarrow w'\). The first condition is immediate. If
\(Rwv\), assume there is no \(v'\) in \(\fM'\) with \(R'w'v'\) and
\(v\leftrightsquigarrow v'\). Let \(S'=\{u'\mid R'w'u'\}\). Note that \(S'\)
must be non-empty, for otherwise \(\fM',w'\Vdash\Box\bot\), which would
contradict \(w\leftrightsquigarrow w'\) since \(\fM,w\Vdash\diamond\top\).
Furthermore, as \(\fM'\) is image-finite, \(S'\) must be finite, say
\(S'=\{w_1',\dots,w_n'\}\). By assumption, for every \(w_i'\in S'\) there
exists a formula \(\psi_i\) s.t. \(\fM,v\Vdash\psi_i\), but
\(\fM',w_i'\not\Vdash\psi_i\). It follows that
\begin{equation*}
\fM,w\Vdash\diamond(\psi_1\wedge\dots\wedge\psi_n)\quad\text{ and }\quad
\fM',w'\not\Vdash\diamond(\psi_1\wedge\dots\wedge \psi_n)
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex2.2.8}
Suppose that \(\{Z_i\mid i\in I\}\) is a non-empty collection of
bisimulations between \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\). Prove that the relation
\(\bigcup_{i\in I}Z_i\) is also a bisimulation between \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\).
Conclude that if \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\) are bisimilar, then there is a maximal
bisimulation between \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\).
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If \((w,w')\in\bigcup_{i\in I}Z_i\), then \((w,w')\in Z_j\) for some
\(j\in I\) and hence they satisfy the same propositional letters
\item If \((w,w')\in\bigcup_{i\in I}Z_i\) and \(R_{\triangle}wv_1\dots v_n\),
since \((w,w')\in Z_j\) for some \(j\in I\), we have
\(R'_{\triangle}w'v_1'\dots v_n'\) and \(v_iZ_jv_i'\) for all \(1\le i\le
      n\), which means \((v_i,v_i')\in\bigcup_{i\in I}Z_i\) for all \(1\le i\le n\)
\item similarly
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Bisimulations for the Basic Temporal Language and Arrow Logic]
When working with the basic temporal language, we usually work with models
\((W,R,V)\) and implicitly take \(R_p\) to be \(R^\smallsmile\). Thus we need
a notion of bisimulation between models \((W,R,V)\) and \((W',R',V')\) to be
a relation \(Z\) between the states of the two models that satisfies the
clauses of Definition \ref{def2.16}, and in addition the following
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item If \(wZw'\) and \(Rvw\), then there exists \(v'\) in \(\fM'\) s.t.
\(vZv'\) and \(R'v'w'\)
\item Converse of 4: if \(wZw'\) and \(R'v'w'\), then there exists \(v\) in
\(\fM\) s.t. \(vZv'\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\subsection{Finite Models}
\label{sec:org857c898}
\begin{definition}[Finite Model Property]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, and let \(\sfM\) be a class of
\(\tau\)-models. We say that \(\tau\) has the \textbf{finite model property w.r.t.} \(\sfM\)
if the following holds: if \(\phi\) is a formula of similarity type \(\tau\), and \(\phi\) is
satisfiable in some model in \(\sfM\), then \(\phi\) is satisfiable in a \textbf{finite}
model in \(\sfM\)
\end{definition}
\subsubsection{Selecting a finite submodel}
\label{sec:org198eef9}
\begin{definition}[Degree]
We define the \textbf{degree} of modal formulas as follows:
\begin{align*}
\deg(p)\quad&=\quad 0\\
\deg(\bot)\quad&=\quad0\\
\deg(\neg\phi)\quad&=\quad\deg(\phi)\\
\deg(\phi\vee\psi)\quad&=\quad\max\{\deg(\phi),\deg(\psi)\}\\
\deg(\triangle(\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n))\quad&=\quad
1+\max\{\deg(\phi_1),\dots,\deg(\phi_2)\}
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[]
\label{prop2.29}
Let \(\tau\) be a finite modal similarity type, and assume our collection of
proposition letters is finite as well
\begin{enumerate}
\item for all \(n\), up to logical equivalence there are only finitely many
formulas of degree at most \(n\)
\item for all \(n\), and every \(\tau\)-model \(\fM\) and state \(w\) of
\(\fM\), the set of all \(\tau\)-formulas of degree at most \(n\) that
are satisfied by \(w\), is equivalent to a single formula
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}[$n$-Bisimulation]
Let \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\) be models, and let \(w\) and \(w'\) be states of
\(\fM\) and \(\fM'\), respectively. We say that \(w\) and \(w'\) are
\textbf{\(n\)-bisimilar} (\(w\leftrightarroweq_nw'\)) if there exists a sequence of
binary relations \(Z_n\subseteq\cdots\subseteq Z_0\) with the following
properties (for \(i+1\le n\))
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(wZ_nw'\)
\item if \(vZ_0v'\) then \(v\) and \(v'\) agree on all proposition letters
\item if \(vZ_{i+1}v'\) and \(Rvu\) then there exists \(u'\) with \(R'v'u'\)
and \(uZ_iu'\)
\item if \(vZ_{i+1}v'\) and \(R'v'u'\), then there exists \(u\) with \(Rvu\)
and \(uZ_iu'\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[]
\label{prop2.31}
Let \(\tau\) be a finite modal similarity type, \(\Phi\) a finite set of proposition
letters, and let \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\) be models for this language. Then for
every \(w\) in \(\fM\) and \(w'\) in \(\fM'\), the following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(w\leftrightarroweq_nw'\)
\item \(w\) and \(w'\) agree on all modal formulas of degree at most \(n\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\(2\to 1\). if \(n=0\), obvious.

If \(n=k\) and the proposition holds. Now suppose \(n=k+1\). Now \(w\) and
\(w'\) agree on all modal formulas of degree at most \(n+1\). If
there is not \(v,v'\) s.t. \(v\) and \(v'\) agree on all modal formulas of
degree at most \(n\) and \(Rwv\) and \(Rwv'\). Let \(S'=\{u'\mid R'w'u'\}\)
and \(S'\) is finite, say \(S'==\{w_1',\dots,w_n'\}\). By assumption, for
every \(w_i'\in S'\) there exists a formula \(\psi_i\)  of degree at most
\(n\) s.t. \(\fM,v\Vdash\psi_i\) but \(\fM',w_i'\not\Vdash\psi_i\). It
follows that
\begin{equation*}
\fM,w\Vdash\diamond(\psi_1\wedge\dots\wedge\psi_n)
\text{ and }
\fM',w'\not\Vdash\diamond(\psi_1\wedge\dots\wedge\psi_n)
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type containing only diamonds. Let
\(\fM=(W,R_1,\dots,R_n,\dots,V)\) be a rooted \(\tau\)-model with root
\(w\). The notion of the \textbf{height} of states in \(\fM\) is defined by
induction.

The only element of height 0 is the rot of the model; the states of height
\(n+1\) are those immediate successors of elements of height \(n\) that have
not yet assigned a height smaller than \(n+1\). The \textbf{height of a model} \(\fM\)
is the maximum \(n\) s.t. there is a state of height \(n\) in \(\fM\), if
such a maximum exists; otherwise the height of \(\fM\) is infinite

For a natural number \(k\), the \textbf{restriction} of \(\fM\) to \(k\)
(\(\fM\restriction k\)) is defined as the submodel containing only states
whose height is at most \(k\). \((\fM\restriction
    k)=(W_k,R_{1k},\dots,R_{nk},\dots,V_k)\), where
\(W_k=\{v\mid\text{height}(v)\le k\}\), \(R_{nk}=R_n\cap(W_k\times W_k)\),
and for each \(p\), \(V_k(p)=V(p)\cap W_k\)
\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}[]
\label{lemma2.33}
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type that contains only diamonds. Let \(\fM\) be
a rooted \(\tau\)-models, and let \(k\) be a natural number. Then for every
state \(w\) of \((\fM\restriction k)\), we have \((\fM\restriction
    k),w\leftrightarroweq_l\fM,w\), where \(l=k-\text{height}(w)\)
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[Finite Model Property - via Selection]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type containing only diamonds, and let \(\phi\) be a
\(\tau\)-formula. If \(\phi\) is satisfiable, then it is satisfiable on a finite model
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Fix a modal formula \(\phi\) with \(\deg(\phi)=k\). We restrict our modal similarity
type \(\tau\) and our collection of proposition letters to the modal operators and
proposition letters actually occurring in \(\phi\). Let \(\fM_1,w_1\) be s.t.
\(\fM_1,w_1\Vdash\phi\). By Proposition \ref{prop2.15}, there exists a
tree-like model \(\fM_2\) with root \(w_2\) s.t. \(\fM_2,w_2\Vdash\phi\).
Let \(\fM_3:=(\fM_2\restriction k)\). By Lemma \ref{lemma2.33} we have
\(\fM_2,w_2\leftrightarroweq_k\fM_3,w_2\) and by Proposition \ref{prop2.31} it
follows that \(\fM_3,w_2\Vdash\phi\)

By induction on \(n\le k\) we define finite sets of states \(S_0,\dots,S_k\)
and a (final) model \(\fM_4\) with domain \(S_0\cup\cdots\cup S_k\); the
points in each \(S_n\) will have height \(n\)

Define \(S_0\) to be the singleton \(\{w_2\}\). Next, assume that
\(S_0,\dots,S_n\) have already been defined. Fix an element \(v\) of
\(S_n\). By Proposition \ref{prop2.29} there are only finitely many
non-equivalent modal formulas whose degree is at most \(k-n\), say
\(\psi_1,\dots,\psi_m\). For each formula that is of the form \(\la
    a\ra\chi\) and holds in \(\fM_3\) at \(v\), select a state \(u\) from
\(\fM_3\) s.t. \(R_avu\) and \(\fM_3,u\Vdash\chi\). Add all these \(u\)s to
\(S_{n+1}\), and repeat this selection process for every state in \(S_n\).
\(S_{n+1}\) is defined as the set of all points that have been selected in
this way

Finally, define \(\fM_4\) as follows. Its domain is \(S_0\cup\dots\cup
    S_k\); as each \(S_i\) is finite, \(\fM_4\) is finite. The relations and
valuation are obtained by restricting the relations and valuations of
\(\fM_3\) to the domain of \(\fM_4\)
\end{proof}
\subsubsection{Finite models via filtrations}
\label{sec:org2ca7630}

\begin{definition}[]
A set of formulas \(\Sigma\) is \textbf{closed under subformulas} (or \textbf{subformula closed}) if
for all formulas \(\phi\), \(\phi'\): if \(\phi\vee\phi'\in\Sigma\) then so are
\(\phi\) and \(\phi'\); if \(\neg\phi\in\Sigma\) then so is \(\phi\); and if
\(\triangle(\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n)\in\Sigma\) then so are \(\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n\)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Filtrations]
We work in the basic modal language. Let \(\fM=(W,R,V)\) be a model and \(\Sigma\) a
subformula closed set of formulas. Let \(\leftrightsquigarrow_\Sigma\) be
the relation on the states of \(\fM\) defined by
\begin{equation*}
w\leftrightsquigarrow_\Sigma v \text{ iff for all }\phi\in\Sigma:
(\fM,w\Vdash\phi\text{ iff }\fM,v\Vdash\phi)
\end{equation*}
Note that \(\leftrightsquigarrow_\Sigma\) is an equivalence relation. We
denote the equivalence class of a state \(w\) of \(\fM\) w.r.t.
\(\leftrightsquigarrow_\Sigma\) by \(\abs{w}_\Sigma\), or simply
\(\abs{w}\). The mapping \(w\mapsto\abs{w}\) is called the \textbf{natural map}

Let \(W_\Sigma=\{\abs{w}_\Sigma\mid w\in W\}\). Suppose \(\fM_\Sigma^f\) is
any model \((W^f,R^f,V^f)\) s.t.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(W^f=W_\Sigma\)
\item if \(Rwv\) then \(R^f\abs{w}\abs{v}\)
\item if \(R^f\abs{w}\abs{v}\) then for all \(\diamond\phi\in\Sigma\), if
\(\fM,v\Vdash\phi\) then \(\fM,w\Vdash\diamond\phi\)
\item \(V^f(p)=\{\abs{w}\mid\fM,w\Vdash p\}\), for all proposition letters
\(p\) in \(\Sigma\)
\end{enumerate}


\(\fM_\Sigma^f\) is called a \textbf{filtration of \(fM\) through} \(\Sigma\); we will
often suppress subscripts and write \(\fM^f\) instead of \(\fM_\Sigma^f\)
\end{definition}
\label{def2.36}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{/media/wu/file/stuuudy/notes/images/ModalLogic/Filtration.png}
\end{center}

Let \(\fM=(\N,R,V)\) , where \(R=\{(0,1),(0,2),(1,3)\}\cup\{(n,n+1)\mid
    n\ge2\}\), and \(V\) has \(V(p)=\N\setminus\{0\}\) and \(V(q)=\{2\}\)

Further assume \(\Sigma=\{\diamond p,p\}\). \(\Sigma\) is subformula closed. Then,
the model
\(\fN=(\{\abs{0},\abs{1}\},\{(\abs{0},\abs{1}),(\abs{1},\abs{1})\},V')\),
where \(V'(p)=\{\abs{1}\}\) is a filtration of \(\fM\) through \(\Sigma\). \(\fN\) is
not a bounded morphic image of \(\fM\): any bounded morphism would have to
preserve the formula \(q\)

\begin{proposition}[]
Let \(\Sigma\) be a finite subformula closed set of basic modal formulas. For any
model \(\fM\), if \(\fM^f\) is a filtration of \(\fM\) through a subformula
closed set \(\Sigma\), then \(\fM^f\) contains at most \(2^n\) nodes (where \(n\)
denotes the size of \(\Sigma\))
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The states of \(\fM^f\) are the equivalence classes in \(W_\Sigma\). Let
\(g\) be the function with domain \(W_\Sigma\) and range \(\calp(\Sigma)\)
defined by \(g(\abs{w})=\{\phi\in\Sigma\mid\fM,w\Vdash\phi\}\). It follows
from the definition of \(\leftrightsquigarrow_\Sigma\) that \(g\) is well
defined and injective. Thus \(\abs{W_\Sigma}\le 2^n,n=\abs{\Sigma}\)
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Filtration Theorem]
Consider the basic modal language. Let \(\fM^f=(W_\Sigma,R^f,V^f)\) be a
filtration of \(\fM\) through a subformula closed set \(\Sigma\). Then for all
formulas \(\phi\in\Sigma\), and all nodes \(w\) in \(\fM\), we have
\(\fM,w\Vdash\phi\) iff \(\fM^f,\abs{w}\Vdash\phi\)
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose \(\diamond\phi\in\Sigma\) and \(\fM,w\Vdash\diamond\phi\). Then there
is a \(v\) s.t. \(Rwv\) and \(\fM,v\Vdash\phi\). As \(\fM^f\) is a
filtration, \(R^f\abs{w}\abs{v}\). As \(\Sigma\) is a subformula closed,
\(\phi\in\Sigma\), thus by the inductive hypothesis
\(\fM^f,\abs{v}\Vdash\phi\). Hence \(\fM^f,\abs\Vdash\diamond\phi\)

Suppose \(\diamond\phi\in\Sigma\) and \(\fM^f,\abs{w}\Vdash\diamond\phi\).
Thus there is a state \(\abs{v}\) in \(\fM^f\) s.t. \(R^f\abs{w}\abs{v}\)
and \(\fM^f,\abs{v}\Vdash\phi\). As \(\phi\in\Sigma\), we have
\(\fM,v\Vdash\phi\). By the definition, we have \(\fM,w\Vdash\diamond\phi\)
\end{proof}

Note that clauses 2 and 3 of Definition \ref{def2.36} are designed to make the
modal case of the inductive step go through.

Define
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(R^s\abs{w}\abs{v}\) iff \(\exists w'\in\abs{w}\exists v'\in\abs{v}Rw'v'\)
\item \(R^l\abs{w}\abs{v}\) iff for all formulas \(\diamond\phi\in\Sigma\):
\(\fM,v\Vdash\phi\) implies \(\fM,w\Vdash\diamond\phi\)
\end{enumerate}


These relations give rise to the \textbf{smallest} and \textbf{largest} filtrations respectively

\begin{lemma}[]
Consider the basic modal language. Let \(\fM\) be any model, \(\Sigma\) any
subformula closed set of formulas, \(W_\Sigma\) the set of equivalence
classes induced by \(\leftrightsquigarrow_\Sigma\), and \(V^f\) the standard
valuation on \(W_\Sigma\). Then both \((W_\Sigma,R^s,V^f)\) and
\((W_\Sigma,R^l,V^f)\) are filtrations of \(\fM\) through \(\Sigma\). Furthermore, if
\((W_\Sigma, R^f,V^f)\) is any filtration of \(\fM\) through \(\Sigma\), then
\(R^s\subseteq R^f\subseteq R^l\)
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If \(Rwv\), if \(\fM,v\Vdash\phi\), then \(\fM,w\Vdash\diamond\phi\), hence
\(R^l\abs{w}\abs{v}\)

For any \((W_\Sigma,R^f,V^f)\). \(R^s\subseteq R^f\) by clause 2.
\(R^f\subseteq R^l\) by clause 2
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Finite Model Property - via Filtrations]
Let \(\phi\) be a basic modal formula. if \(\phi\) is satisfiable, then it is satisfiable
on a finite model. Indeed, it is satisfiable on a finite model containing at
most \(2^m\) nodes, where \(m\) is the number of subformulas of \(\phi\)
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Assume that \(\phi\) is satisfiable on a model \(\fM\); take any filtration of
\(\fM\) through the set of subformulas .
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[]
Let \(\fM\) be a model, \(\Sigma\) a subformula closed set of formulas, and
\(W_\Sigma\) the set of equivalence classes induced on \(\fM\) by
\(\leftrightsquigarrow_\Sigma\). Let \(R^t\) be the binary relation on
\(W_\Sigma\) defined by
\begin{equation*}
R^t\abs{w}\abs{v} \text{ iff for all }\phi, \text{ if }\diamond\phi\in\Sigma
\text{ and }\fM,v\Vdash\phi\vee\diamond\phi\text{ then }\fM,w\Vdash\diamond\phi
\end{equation*}
If \(R\) is transitive then \((W_\Sigma,R^t,V^f)\) is a filtration and
\(R^t\) is transitive
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}[]
Let \((W,R,V)\) be a transitive frame. A \textbf{cluster} on \((W,R,V)\) is a
maximal, nonempty equivalence class under \(R\). That is, \(C\subseteq W\)
is a cluster if the restriction of \(R\) to \(C\) is an equivalence relation

A cluster is \textbf{simple} if it consists of a single reflexive point, and \textbf{proper}
if it consists more than one point
\end{definition}
\subsection{The Standard Translation}
\label{sec:orgd0c1fb2}
\begin{definition}[]
For \(\tau\) a modal similarity type and \(\Phi\) a collection of proposition letters, let
\(\call_\tau^1(\Phi)\) be the first-order language (with equality) which has
unary predicates \(P_0,P_1,\dots\) corresponding to the proposition letters
\(p_0,p_1,\dots\) in \(\Phi\), and an \((n+1)\)-ary relation symbol \(R_{\triangle}\)
for each (\(n\)-ary) modal operator \(\triangle\) in our similarity type. We
write \(\alpha(x)\) to denote a first-order formula \(\alpha\) with one free variable, \(x\)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Standard Translation]
Let \(x\) be a first-order variable. The \textbf{standard translation} \(ST_x\) taking
modal formulas to first-order formulas in \(\call_\tau^1(\Phi)\) is defined as
\begin{align*}
ST_x(p)&\quad\text{=}\quad Px\\
ST_x(\bot)&\quad\text{=}\quad x\neq x\\
ST_x(\neg\phi)&\quad\text{=}\quad \neg ST_x(\phi)\\
ST_x(\phi\vee\psi)&\quad\text{=}\quad ST_x(\phi)\vee ST_x(\psi)\\
ST_x(\triangle(\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n))&\quad\text{=}\quad \exists y_1\dots
\exists y_n(R_{\triangle} xy_1\dots y_n\wedge\\
&\hspace{2cm}ST_{y_1}(\phi_1)\wedge\dots\wedge ST_{y_n}(\phi_n) )
\end{align*}
where \(y_1,\dots,y_n\) are fresh variables.
\end{definition}

\begin{gather*}
ST_x(\diamond\phi)=\exists y(Rxy\wedge ST_y(\phi))\\
ST_x(\Box\phi)=\forall y(Rxy\to ST_y(\phi))
\end{gather*}

\begin{proposition}[Local and Global Correspondence on Models]
\label{prop2.47}
Fix a modal similarity type \(\tau\), and let \(\phi\) be a \(\tau\)-formula. Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item For all \(\fM\) and all states \(w\) of \(\fM\): \(\fM,w\Vdash \phi\) iff
\(\fM\models ST_x(\phi)[w]\)
\item For all \(\fM\): \(\fM\Vdash\phi\) iff \(\fM\models\forall x ST_x(\phi)\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}[]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type that only contains diamonds. Then, every
\(\tau\)-formula \(\phi\) is equivalent to a first-order formula containing at
most two variables
\item If \(\tau\) does not contain modal operators \(\triangle\) whose arity exceeds
\(n\), all \(\tau\)-formulas are equivalent to first-order formulas
containing at most \((n+1)\) vairables
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Assume \(\tau\) contains only diamonds \(\la a\ra,\la b\ra\). Fix two distinct
variables \(x\) and \(y\). Define two variants \(ST_x\) and \(ST_y\) of the
standard translation as follows
\begin{alignat*}{2}
&ST_x(p)=Px&&ST_y(p)=Py\\
&ST_x(\bot)=x\neq x\quad&&ST_y(\bot)=y\neq y\\
&ST_x(\neg\phi)=\neg ST_x(\phi)&&ST_y(\neg\phi)=\neg ST_y(\phi)\\
&ST_x(\phi\vee\psi)=ST_x(\phi)\vee ST_x(\psi)&&ST_y(\phi\vee\psi)=ST_y(\phi)\vee ST_y(\psi)\\
&ST_x(\la a\ra\phi)=\exists y(R_axy\wedge ST_y(\phi))\quad&&
ST_y(\la a\ra\phi)=\exists x(R_ayx\wedge ST_x(\phi))
\end{alignat*}
Then for any \(\tau\)-formula \(\phi\), its \(ST_x\)-translation contains at most
the two variables \(x\) and \(y\), and \(ST_x(\phi)\) is equivalent to the
original standard translation of \(\phi\)
\end{proof}

\begin{examplle}[]
\begin{align*}
ST_x(\diamond(\Box p\to q))&=
\exists y(Rxy\wedge ST_y(\Box p\to q))\\
&=\exists y(Rxy\wedge(\forall x(Ryx\to ST_x(p))\to Qy))\\
&=\exists y(Rxy\wedge(\forall x(Ryx\to Px)\to Qy))
\end{align*}
\end{examplle}

\(Rxx\) is not equivalent to any modal formula. Suppose \(\phi\) is a modal formula
s.t. \(ST_x(\phi)\) is equivalent to \(Rxx\). Let \(\fM\) be a singleton
reflexive model and let \(w\) be the unique state in \(\fM\); obviously
\(\fM\models Rxx[w]\). Let \(\fN\) be a model based on the strict ordering of
the integers; for every integer \(v\), \(\fN\models\neg Rxx[v]\). Let \(Z\)
be the relation which links every integer with the unique state in \(fM\),
and assume that the valuations in \(\fN\) and \(\fM\) are s.t. \(Z\) is a
bisimulation.
\begin{equation*}
\fM\models Rxx[w]\Rightarrow\fM,w\Vdash\phi\Rightarrow\fN,v\Vdash\phi
\Rightarrow\fN\models Rxx[v]
\end{equation*}

\begin{definition}[]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, \(\sfC\) a class of \(\tau\)-models, and \(\Gamma\)
a set of formulas over \(\tau\). We say that \(\Gamma\) \textbf{defines} of \textbf{characterizes} a class
\(\sfK\) of models \textbf{within} \(\sfC\) if for all models \(\fM\) in \(\sfC\) we
have that \(\fM\) is in \(\sfK\) iff \(\fM\Vdash\Gamma\). If \(\sfC\) is the
class of all \(\tau\)-models, we simply say that \(\Gamma\) defines or characterizes
\(\sfK\); we omit brackets whenever \(\Gamma\) is a singleton. We say that a formula \(\phi\)
defines a \textbf{property} whenever \(\phi\) defines the class of models satisfying the property

\subsection{Modal Saturation via Ultrafilter Extensions}
\label{sec:org168ebcf}
\subsubsection{M-saturation}
\label{sec:org64b9e17}
\begin{definition}[Hennessy-Milner Classes]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, and \(\sfK\) a class of \(\tau\)-models.
\(\sfK\) is a \textbf{Hennessy-Milner} class, or \textbf{has the Hennessy-Milner property}, if
for every two models \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\) in \(\sfK\) and any two states
\(w,w'\) of \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\), respectively, \(w\leftrightsquigarrow w'\)
implies \(\fM,w\leftrightarroweq \fM',w'\)
\end{definition}

For example, by Theorem \ref{thm2.24} the class of image-finite models has the
Hennessy-Milner property.

Suppose we are working in the basic modal language. Let \(\fM=(W,R,V)\) be a
model, let \(w\) be a state in \(W\) and let
\(\Sigma=\{\phi_0,\phi_1,\dots\}\) be an infinite set of formulas. Suppose
that \(w\) has successors \(v_0,v_1,\dots,\) where respectively
\(\phi_0,\phi_0\wedge\phi_1,\phi_0\wedge\phi_1\wedge\phi_2,\dots\) hold. If
there is no successor \(v\) of \(w\) where \textbf{all} formulas from \(\Sigma\) hold \textbf{at the
same time}, then the model is in some sense incomplete. A model is called
m-saturated if incompleteness of this kind does not occur

Suppose that we are looking for a successor of \(w\) at which every formula
\(\phi_i\) of the infinite set of formulas
\(\Sigma=\{\phi_0,\phi_1,\dots\}\) holds. M-saturation is a kind of
compactness property, according to which it suffices to find satisfying
successors of \(w\) for arbitrary finite approximations of \(\Sigma\)

\begin{definition}[M-saturation]
Let \(\fM=(W,R,V)\) be a model of the basic modal similarity type, \(X\) a
subset of \(W\) and \(\Sigma\) a set of modal formulas. \(\Sigma\) is \textbf{satisfiable} in the set
\(X\) if there is a state \(x\in X\) s.t. \(\fM,x\Vdash\phi\) for all
\(\phi\in\Sigma\). \(\Sigma\) is \textbf{finitely satisfiable} in \(X\) if every finite subset
of \(\Sigma\) is satisfiable in \(X\)

The model \(\fM\) is called \textbf{\(m\)-saturated} if it satisfies the following
condition for every state \(w\in W\) and every set \(\Sigma\) of modal formulas:

\begin{center}
If \(\Sigma\) is finitely satisfiable in the set of successors of \(w\), \par
then
\(\Sigma\) is satisfiable in the set of successors of \(w\)
\end{center}

Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, and let \(\fM\) be a \(\tau\)-model.
\(\fM\) is called \textbf{\(m\)-saturated} if for every state \(w\) of \(\fM\) and
every (\(n\)-ary) modal operator \(\triangle\in\tau\) and sequence
\(\Sigma_1,\dots,\Sigma_n\) of sets of modal formulas, we have the
following:

\begin{center}
    If for every sequence of finite subsets \(\Delta_1\subset\Sigma_1,\dots,\Delta_n
    \subseteq\Sigma_n\), there are states \(v_1,\dots,v_n\) s.t.
    \(Rwv_1\dots v_n\) and \(v_1\Vdash\Delta_1,\dots,v_n\Vdash\Delta_n\),\par
    then there are states \(v_1,\dots,v_n\) in \(\fM\) s.t. \(Rwv_1\dots v_n\) and
    \(v_1\Vdash\Sigma_1,\dots v_n\Vdash\Sigma_n\)
\end{center}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[]
\label{prop2.54}
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type. Then the class of \(m\)-saturated
\(\tau\)-models has the Hennessy-Milner property
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let \(\fM=(W,R,V)\)  and \(\fM'=(W',R',V')\) be two m-saturated models.

Assume that \(w,v\in W\) and \(w'\in W'\) are s.t. \(Rwv\) and
\(w\leftrightsquigarrow w'\). Let \(\Sigma\) be the set of formulas true at \(v\). It
is clear that for every finite subset \(\Delta\) of \(\Sigma\) we have
\(\fM,v\Vdash\bigwedge\Delta\), hence
\(\fM,w\Vdash\diamond\bigwedge\Delta\). As \(w\leftrightsquigarrow w'\), it
follows that \(\fM',w'\Vdash\diamond\bigwedge\Delta\), so \(w'\) has an
\(R'\)-successor \(v_\Delta\) s.t. \(\fM',v_\Delta\Vdash\bigwedge\Delta\).
In other words, \(\Sigma\) is finitely satisfiable in the set of successors of
\(w'\); but then, by m-saturation, \(\Sigma\) itself is satisfiable in a successor
\(v'\) of \(w'\). Thus \(v\leftrightsquigarrow v'\)
\end{proof}
\subsubsection{Ultrafilter extensions}
\label{sec:org95079fb}
\begin{definition}[Filters and Ultrafilters]
Let \(W\) be a non-empty set. A \textbf{filter} \(F\) \textbf{over} \(W\) is a set
\(F\subseteq\calp(W)\) s.t.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(W\in F\)
\item If \(X,Y\in F\), then \(X\cap Y\in F\)
\item If \(X\in F\) and \(X\subseteq Z\subseteq W\), then \(Z\in F\)
\end{enumerate}


An \textbf{ultrafilter over \(W\)} is a proper filter s.t. for all \(X\in\calp(W)\),
\(X\in U\) iff \((W\setminus X)\in U\)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[]
Let \(W\) be a non-empty set, and let \(E\) be a subset of \(\calp(W)\). By
the \textbf{filter generated by} \(E\) we mean the intersection \(F\) of the
collection of all filters over \(W\) which include \(E\)
\begin{equation*}
F=\bigcap\{G\mid E\subseteq G\text{ and $G$ is a filter over }W\}
\end{equation*}
\(E\) has the \textbf{finite intersection property} if the intersection of any finite
number of elements of \(E\) is non-empty
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Zorn's Lemma]
Whenever \(<\) is a strict partial order of a set \(A\) satisfying for all
chains \(C\subseteq A\) there is some \(b\in A\) s.t. \(x\le b\) for all
\(x\in C\) then for all \(a\in A\), there is a maximal \(b\in A\) with
\(b\ge a\)
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[Ultrafilter Theorem]
Fix a non-empty set \(W\). Any proper filter over \(W\) can be extended to
an ultrafilter over \(W\). As a corollary, any subset of \(\calp(W)\) with
the finite intersection property can be extended to an ultrafilter over \(W\)
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[]
Let \(W\) be a non-empty set. Given an element \(w\in  W\), the \textbf{principal
ultrafilter} \(\pi_w\) generated by \(w\) is the filter generated by the
singleton set \(\{w\}\)
\end{definition}

Suppose \(U\) is an ultrafilter over a non-empty set \(I\), and that for
each \(i\in I\), \(A_i\) is a non-empty set. Let \(C=\prod_{i\in I}A_i\).
That is, \(C\) is the set of all functions \(f\) with domain \(I\) s.t. for
each \(i\in I\), \(f(i)\in A_i\). For two functions \(f,g\in C\) we say that
\(f\) and \(g\) are \textbf{\(U\)-equivalent} (\(f\sim_U g\)) if \(\{i\in I\mid
    f(i)=g(i)\}\in U\)

\begin{proposition}[]
The relation \(\sim_U\) is an equivalence relation on the set \(C\)
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Suppose \(\{i\mid f(i)=g(i)\}\in U,\{i\mid g(i)=h(i)\}\in U\), then
\(\{i\mid f(i)=g(i)=h(i)\}=\{i\mid f(i)=g(i)\}\cap\{i\mid g(i)=h(i)\}\in
    U\). And
\(\{i\mid f(i)=g(i)=h(i)\}\subseteq\{i\mid f(i)=h(i)\}\)
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[]
Let \(f_U\) be the equivalence class of \(f\) modulo \(\sim_U\), that is:
\(f_U=\{g\in C\mid g\sim_U f\}\). The \textbf{ultraproduct of} the sets \(A_i\)
\textbf{modulo} \(U\) is the set of all equivalence classes of \(\sim_U\). It is
denoted by \(\prod_UA_i\). So
\begin{equation*}
\prod_UA_i=\{f_U\mid f\in\prod_{i\in I}A_i\}
\end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[]
Fix a first-order language \(\call^1\), and let \(\fA_i(i\in I)\) be
\(\call^1\)-models. The \textbf{ultraproduct} \(\prod_U\fA_i\) \textbf{of} \(\fA_i\) \textbf{modulo}
\(U\) is the model described as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The universe \(A_U\) is the set \(\prod_UA_i\), where \(A_i\) is the
universe of \(\fA_i\)
\item Let \(R\) be an \(n\)-place relation symbol, and \(R_i\) its
interpretation in the model \(\fA_i\). The relation \(R_U\) in
\(\prod_U\fA_i\) is given by
\begin{equation*}
R_Uf_U^1\dots f_U^n \quad\text{ iff }\quad
\{i\in I\mid R_if^1(i)\dots f^n(i)\}\in U
\end{equation*}
\item Let \(F\) be an \(n\)-place function symbol, and \(F_i\) its
interpretation in \(\fA_i\). The function \(F_U\) in \(\prod_U\fA_i\) is
given by
\begin{equation*}
F_U(f_U^1,\dots,f_U^n)=
\{(i,F_i(f^1(i),\dots,f^n(i)))\mid i\in I\}_U
\end{equation*}
\item Let \(c\) be a constant, and \(a_i\) its interpretation in \(\fA_i\).
Then \(c\) is interpreted by the element \(c'\in\prod_UA_i\) where
\(c'=\{(i,a_i)\mid i\in I\}_U\)
\end{enumerate}


In the case where all the structures are the same, say \(\fA_i=\fA\) for all
\(i\), we speak of the \textbf{ultrapower} of \(\fA\)  modulo \(U\), notation \(\prod_U\fA\)
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Łoś's Theorem]
\label{thmA.19}
Let \(U\) be an ultrafilter over a non-empty set \(I\). For each \(i\in I\),
let \(\fA_i\) be a model
\begin{enumerate}
\item For every term \(t(x_1,\dots,x_n)\) and all elements
\(f_U^1,\dots,f_U^n\) of \(\fB=\prod_U\fA_i\) we have
\begin{equation*}
t^{\fB}[x_1\mapsto f_U^1,\dots,x_n\mapsto f_U^n]=
\{(i,t^{\fA_i}[f^1(i),\dots,f^n(i)])\mid i\in I\}_U
\end{equation*}
\item Given any first-order formula \(\alpha(x_1,\dots,x_n)\) in \(\call_\tau^1\)
and \(f_U^1,\dots,f_U^n\) in \(\prod_U\fA_i\) we have
\begin{equation*}
\prod_U\fA_i\models\alpha[f_U^1,\dots,f_U^n]
\quad\text{ iff }\quad
\{i\in I\mid\fA_i\models\alpha[f^1(i),\dots,f^n(i)]\}\in U
\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 

\item Induction on \(\alpha\). The atomic case holds by definition. Suppose that
\(\alpha\equiv\neg\beta(x_1,\dots,x_n)\), then
\begin{align*}
\prod_U\fA_i\models\alpha[f_U^1\dots f_U^n]&\quad\text{ iff }\quad
\prod_U\fA_i\not\models\beta[f_U^1,\dots,f_U^n]\\
&\quad\text{ iff }\quad
\{i\in I\mid\fA_i\models\beta[f_U^1,\dots,f_U^n]\}\not\in U\\
&\quad\text{ iff }\quad
\{i\in I\mid\fA_i\not\models\beta[f^1(i),\dots,f^n(i)]\}\in U\\
&\quad\text{ iff }\quad
\{i\in I\mid\fA_i\models\alpha[f^1(i),\dots,f^n(i)]\}\in U
\end{align*}
The second equivalence follows from the inductive hypothesis, and the
third from the fact that \(U\) is an ultrafilter

Suppose that \(\alpha(x_1,\dots,x_n)\equiv\exists x_0\beta(x_0,\dots,x_n)\),
then
\begin{align}
\prod_U\fA_i\models\alpha[f_U^1,\dots,f_U^n]&\quad\text{ iff }\quad
\exists f_U^0\in\prod_U\fA_i,\prod_U\fA_i\models\beta[f_U^0,\dots,f_U^n]\nonumber\\
&\quad\text{ iff }\quad
\exists f_U^0\in\prod_U\fA_i,\{i\in I\mid\fA_i\models\beta[f^0(i),\dots,f^n(i)]\}\in U
\label{eqA.2}
\end{align}
As \(\fA_i\models\beta[f^0(i),\dots,f^n(i)]\) implies
\(\fA_i\models\alpha[f^1(i),\dots,f^n(i)]\), which means
\begin{equation*}
\{i\in I\mid\fA_i\models\beta[f^0(i),\dots,f^n(i)]\}\subseteq
\{i\in I\mid\fA_i\models\alpha[f^1(i),\dots,f^n(i)]\}
\end{equation*}
Hence
\begin{equation}
\{i\in I\mid\fA_i\models\alpha[f^1(i),\dots,f^n(i)]\}\in U\label{eqA.3}
\end{equation}
Conversely, if \eqref{eqA.3} holds, then we can select a function
\(f^0\in\prod_{i\in I}A_i\) s.t. \eqref{eqA.2} holds. So \eqref{eqA.2} is
equivalent to \eqref{eqA.3}
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[]
\label{corA.20}
Let \(\prod_U\fA\) be an ultrapower of \(\fA\). Then for all first-order
sentences \(\alpha\), \(\fA\models\alpha\) iff \(\prod_U\fA\models\alpha\)
\end{corollary}

There is a natural embedding of a model \(\fA\) in each of its ultrapowers.
Define the \textbf{diagonal mapping} \(d\) of \(\fA\) into \(\prod_U\fA\) to be the
function
\begin{equation*}
\alpha\mapsto(f_\alpha)_U,\text{ where }f_a(i)=a\text{ for all }i\in I
\end{equation*}

\begin{corollary}[]
Let \(\prod_U\fA\) be an ultrapower of \(\fA\). Then the diagonal mapping of
\(\fA\) into \(\prod_U\fA\) is an elementary embedding
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
\begin{align*}
\prod_U\fA\models\alpha[d(a_1),\dots,d(a_n)]&\quad\text{ iff }\quad
\{i\in I\mid\fA\models\alpha[a_1,\dots,a_n]\}\in U\\
&\quad\text{ iff }\quad \fA\models\alpha[a_1,\dots,a_n]
\end{align*}
\end{proof}


\(V(\phi)=\{w\mid \fM,w\Vdash\phi\}\)

\begin{definition}[]
Given an \((n+1)\)-ary relation \(R\) on a set \(W\), we define the
following two \(n\)-ary operations \(m_R\) and \(l_R\) on the power set
\(\calp(W)\) of \(W\):
\begin{align*}
m_R(X_1,\dots,X_n)&:=\{w\in W\mid\exists w_1,\dots,w_n
(Rww_1\dots w_n\bigwedge\forall i(w_i\in X_i))\}\\
l_R(X_1,\dots,X_n)&:=\{w\in W\mid\forall w_1,\dots,w_n
(Rww_1\dots w_n\to\exists i(w_i\in X_i))\}\\
m_R(V(\phi_1),\dots,V(\phi_n))&:=V(\triangle(\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n))\\
l_R(V(\phi_1),\dots,V(\phi_n))&:=V(\triangledown(\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n))
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

It follows that for any  model \(\fM=(W,R,V)\) we have
\begin{equation*}
V(\diamond\phi)=m_R(V(\phi))\quad\text{ and }\quad
V(\Box\phi)=l_R(V(\phi))
\end{equation*}

\begin{proposition}[]
Let \(R\) be a relation of arity \(n+1\) on the set \(W\). Then for every
\(n\)-tuple \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) of subsets of \(W\) we have
\begin{equation*}
l_R(X_1,\dots,X_n)=W\setminus m_R(W\setminus X_1,\dots,W\setminus X_n)
\end{equation*}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
This is actually \(\triangledown=\neg\triangle\neg\)
\begin{align*}
W\setminus m_R(W\setminus X_1,\dots,W\setminus X_n)&=
\{w\mid\neg\exists w_1,\dots,w_n(Rww_1\dots w_n\bigwedge\forall i(w_i\in W\setminus X_i))\}\\
&=\{\forall w_1,\dots,w_n(\neg Rww_1\dots w_n\bigvee\neg\forall i(w_i\in W\setminus X_i))\}\\
&=\{\forall w_1,\dots,w_n(Rww_1\dots w_n\to\exists i(w_i\not\in W\setminus X_i))\}\\
&=l_R(X_1,\dots,X_n)
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}[Ultrafilter Extension]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, and
\(\fF=(W,R_{\triangle})_{ \triangle\in\tau}\) is a \(\tau\)-frame. The
\textbf{ultrafilter extension} \(\fu\fe\fF\) of \(\fF\) is defined as the frame
\((Uf(W),R_{\triangle}^{ue})_{\triangle\in\tau}\). Here \(Uf(W)\) is the set of
ultrafilters over \(W\) and \(R_{\triangle}^{ue}u_0u_1\dots u_n\) holds for
a tuple \(u_0,\dots,u_n\) of ultrafilters over \(W\) if we have that
\(m_{R_{\triangle}}(X_1,\dots,X_n)\in u_0\) whenever \(X_i\in u_i\) for all
\(i\) with \(1\le i\le n\)

The \textbf{ultrafilter extension} of a \(\tau\)-model \(\fM=(\fF,V)\) is the model
\(\fu\fe\fM=(\fu\fe\fF,V^{ue})\) where \(V^{ue}(p_i)\) is the set of
ultrafilters of which \(V(p_i)\) is a member
\end{definition}

Any subset of a frame can be viewed as a \textbf{proposition}. A filter over the
universe of the frame can thus be seen as a \textbf{theory}, in fact as a logically
closed theory, since filters are both closed under intersection
(conjunction) and upward closed (entailment). Viewed this way, a proper
filter is a \textbf{consistent} theory, or \textbf{state of affairs},
for it does not contain the empty set (falsum).
Finally an ultrafilter is a \textbf{complete} theory.

In a given frame \(\fF\) not every state not every state of affairs needs to
'realized', in the sense that there is a state satisfying all and only the
propositions belonging to the state of affairs; only the states of affairs
that correspond to the \textbf{principal} ultrafilters are realized. We build
\(\ue\fF\) by adding every state of affairs for \(\fF\) as a new element of
the domain - that is, \(\ue\fF\) realizes every proposition in \(\fF\)

Stipulate that \(R^{ue}_{\triangle}u_0u_1\dots u_n\) if \(u_0\) 'sees' the
\(n\)-tuple \(u_1,\dots,u_n\). That is, whenever \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) are
propositions of \(u_1,\dots, u_n\) respectively, then \(u_0\) 'sees' this
combination: that is, the proposition \(m_{R_{\triangle}}(X_1,\dots,X_n)\)
is a member of \(u_0\).

\textbf{Principal} ultrafilters over \(W\) plays a special role. By identifying a
state \(w\) of a frame \(\fF\) with the principal ultrafilter
\(\pi_w=\{X\subset W\mid w\in X\}\), it
is easily seen that any frame \(\fF\) is (isomorphic to) a \textbf{submodel} (but in
general not a \textbf{generated} submodel) of its ultrafilter extension. For we have
the following equivalences
\begin{align*}
Rwv &\quad\text{ iff }\quad
w\in m_R(X)\text{ for all }X\subseteq W\text{ s.t. }v\in X\\
&\quad\text{ iff }\quad
m_R(X)\in\pi_w\text{ for all }X\subseteq W\text{ s.t. }X\in\pi_v\\
&\quad\text{ iff }\quad R^{ue}\pi_w\pi_v
\end{align*}
since
\begin{equation*}
Rwv \quad\text{ iff }\quad
\forall X\subseteq W(v\in X\to w\in m_R(X))
\end{equation*}

What is the ultrafilter extension of \(\fN\)? There are two kinds of
ultrafilter over an infinite set: the principal ultrafilter that are in
one-to-one correspondence with the points of the set, and the non-principal
ones which contain all co-finite sets and only infinite sets, cf Exercise
\ref{ex2.5.4}. The principal ultrafilters form an isomorphic copy of the frame
\(\fN\) inside \(\ue\fN\). For any pair \(u,u'\) of ultrafilters, if \(u'\)
is non-principal, then \(R^{ue}uu'\). To set this, let \(X\in u'\). As
\(X\) is infinite, for any \(n\in\N\) there is an \(m\) s.t. \(n<m\) and
\(m\in X\). This show that \(m_<(X)=\N\). But \(\N\) is an element of every
ultrafilter

The shows that the ultrafilter extension of \(\fN\) consists of a copy of
\(\fN\) followed by a uncountable cluster consisting of all the
non-principal ultrafilters
\end{examplle}

\begin{proposition}[]
\label{prop2.59}
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, and \(\fM\) a \(\tau\)-model. Then for any
formula \(\phi\) and any ultrafilter \(u\) over \(W\), \(V(\phi)\in u\) iff
\(\ue\fM,u\models\phi\). Hence for every state \(w\) of \(\fM\) we have
\(w\leftrightsquigarrow \pi_w\)
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The second claim of the proposition is immediate from the first one by the
observation that \(w\Vdash\phi\) iff \(w\in V(\phi)\) iff \(V(\phi)\in\pi_w\)

Induction on \(\phi\). The basic case is immediate from the definition of
\(V^{ue}\). Suppose \(\phi\) is of the form \(\neg\psi\), then
\begin{align*}
V(\neg\psi)\in u&\quad\text{ iff }\quad
W\setminus V(\psi)\in u\\
&\quad\text{ iff }\quad V(\psi)\not\in u\\
&\quad\text{ iff }\quad \ue\fM,u\not\Vdash\psi\quad\text{IH}\\
&\quad\text{ iff }\quad \ue\fM,u\Vdash\neg\psi
\end{align*}

Now consider the case where \(\phi\) is of the form \(\diamond\psi\). Assume first
that \(\ue\fM,u\Vdash\diamond\psi\). Then there is an ultrafilter \(u'\)
s.t. \(R^{ue}uu'\) and \(\ue\fM,u'\Vdash\psi\). The induction hypothesis
implies that \(V(\psi)\in u'\), so by the definition of \(R^{ue}\),
\(m_R(V(\psi))\in u\). Now the result follows immediately from the observation
that \(m_R(V(\psi))=V(\diamond\psi)\)

Assume that \(V(\diamond\psi)\in u\). We have to find an ultrafilter \(u'\)
s.t. \(V(\psi)\in u'\) and \(R^{ue}uu'\). The latter constraint reduces to the
condition that \(m_R(X)\in u\) whenever \(X\in u'\), or equivalently (see
Exercise \ref{ex2.5.5})
\begin{equation*}
u_0':=\{Y\mid l_R(Y)\in u\}\subseteq u'
\end{equation*}
We will first show that \(u_0'\) is closed under intersection. Let \(Y,Z\in
    u_0'\). By definition, \(l_R(Y)\) and \(l_R(Z)\) are in \(u\). But then
\(l_R(Y\cap Z)\in u\) as \(l_R(Y\cap Z)=l_R(Y)\cap l_R(Z)\). This proves
that \(Y\cap Z\in u_0'\)

Next we make sure that for any \(Y\in u_0'\), \(Y\cap V(\psi)\neq\emptyset\).
Let \(Y\) be an arbitrary element of \(u_0'\), then by definition of
\(u_0'\), \(l_R(Y)\in u\). As \(u\) is closed under intersection and does
not contain the empty set, there must be an element \(x\in l_R(Y)\cap
    V(\diamond\psi)\). But then \(x\) must have a successor \(y\) in \(V(\psi)\).
Finally, \(x\in l_R(Y)\) implies \(y\in Y\)

From the fact that \(u_0'\) is closed under intersection, and the fact that
for any \(Y\in u_0'\), \(Y\cap V(\psi)\neq\emptyset\), it follows that the set
\(u_0'\cup\{V(\psi)\}\) has the finite intersection property. So the
Ultrafilter Theorem provides us with an ultrafilter \(u'\) s.t.
\(u_0'\cup\{V(\psi)\}\subseteq u'\). This ultrafilter \(u'\) has the desired
properties: it is clearly a successor of \(u\), and the fact the
\(\ue\fM,u'\Vdash\psi\) follows from \(V(\psi)\in u'\) and the induction hypothesis

Our new invariance result can be used to compare the relative expressive

modal language is

\begin{proposition}[]
\label{prop2.61}
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, and let \(\fM\) be a \(\tau\)-model. Then
\(\ue\fM\) is \(m\)-saturated
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let \(\fM=(W,R,V)\) be a model. Consider an ultrafilter \(u\) over \(W\),
and a set \(\Sigma\) of modal formulas which is finitely satisfiable in the set of
successors of \(u\). We have to find an ultrafilter \(u'\) s.t.
\(R^{ue}uu'\) and \(\ue\fM,u'\Vdash\Sigma\). Define
\begin{equation*}
\Delta=\{V(\phi)\mid\phi\in\Sigma'\}\cup\{Y\mid l_R(Y)\in u\}
\end{equation*}
where \(\Sigma'\) is the set of (finite) conjunctions of formulas in \(\Sigma\). We
claim that the set \(\Delta\) has the finite intersection property. Since both
\(\{V(\phi)\mid\phi\in\Sigma'\}\) and \(\{Y\mid l_R(Y)\in u\}\) are closed
under taking intersections, it suffices to prove that for an arbitrary
\(\phi\in\Sigma'\) and an arbitrary set \(Y\subseteq W\) for which
\(l_R(Y)\in u\), we have \(V(\phi)\cap Y\neq\emptyset\). but if
\(\phi\in\Sigma'\), then by assumption, there is a successor \(u''\) of u
s.t. \(\ue\fM,u''\Vdash\phi\), or in other words, \(V(\phi)\in u''\). Then
\(l_R(Y)\in u\) implies \(Y\in u''\) by Exercise \ref{ex2.5.5} . Hence
\(V(\phi)\cap Y\) is an element of the ultrafilter \(u''\) and therefore cannot
be identical to the empty set.

It follows by the Ultrafilter Theorem that \(\Delta\) can be extended to an
ultrafilter \(u'\). Clearly \(u'\) is the required successor
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, and let \(\fM\) and \(\fM'\) be

Let \(W\) be an infinite set. Recall that \(X\subseteq W\) is \textbf{co-finite} if
\(W\setminus X\) is finite
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that the collection of co-finite subsets of \(W\) has the finite
intersection property
\item Show that there are ultrafilters over \(W\) that do not contain any
finite set
\item Prove that an ultrafilter is non-principal iff it contains only infinite

\begin{proof}
Suppose \(U=\{X\subseteq W\mid X\text{ is cofinite}\}\)
\begin{enumerate}
\item For any \(A,B\in U\), if \(A\cap B=\empty\), \(A\subset\bbar{B}\). But
\(A\) is infinite and \(\bbar{B}\) is finite, this can't happen. Hence
\(A\cap B\neq\emptyset\)
\item \(U\) can be extended to a ultrafilter \(\calu\). If \(A\) is finite, then
\(\bbar{A}\in U\subseteq\calu\). Hence \(\calu\) does not contain any
finite set.
\item \(1\to 2\).If an ultrafilter contains a finite set. Then its a principal ultrafilter
generated on the intersection of all finite sets.

\(2\to3\) and \(3\to1\) are obvious.
\item Half of the \(\calp(W)\) belongs to the ultrafilter and \(\calp(W)\) is uncountable

\begin{proof}
\begin{align*}
R^{ue}uv&\Leftrightarrow

\subsection{Characterization and Definability}
\label{sec:org59703be}
\subsubsection{The van Benthem Characterization Theorem}
\label{sec:org2b1d0ce}
Let \(\Gamma(x)\) be a set of first-order formulas in which a single individual
variable may occur free - such a set of formulas is called a \textbf{type}. A
first-order model \(\fM\) \textbf{realizes} \(\Gamma(x)\) if there is an element \(w\) in
\(\fM\) s.t. for all \(\gamma\in\Gamma,\fM\models\gamma[w]\)

Let \(\fM\) be a model for a given first-order language \(\call^1\) with
domain \(W\). For a subset \(A\subset W\), \(\call^1[A]\) is the language
obtained by extending \(\call^1\) with new constant \(\underline{a}\) for
all elements \(a\in A\). \(\fM_A\) is the expansion of \(\fM\) to a
structure for \(\call^1[A]\) in which each \(\underline{a}\) is interpreted
as \(a\)

Assume that \(A\) is of size at most \(\alpha\). Assume that \(\alpha=3\) and
\(A=\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2\}\). Let \(\Gamma(\und{a}_1,\und{a}_2,x)\) be a type of
the language \(\call^1[A]\); \(\Gamma(\und{a}_1,\und{a}_2,x)\) is consistent with
the first-order theory of \(\fM_A\) iff \(\Gamma(\und{a}_1,\und{a}_2,x)\) is
finitely realizable in \(\fM_A\). So for this particular set
\(\Gamma(\und{a}_1,\und{a}_2,x)\), 3-saturation of \(\fM\) means that if
\(\Gamma(\und{a}_1,\und{a}_2,x)\) is finitely realizable in \(\fM_A\), then
\(\Gamma(\und{a}_1,\und{a}_2,x)\) is realizable in \(\fM_A\)

Or consider a formula \(\gamma(\und{a}_1,\und{a}_2,x)\) and let \(\gamma(x_1,x_2,x)\)
be the formula with the fresh variables \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) replacing each
occurrence in \(\gamma\) of \(\und{a}_1\) and \(\und{a}_2\) respectively. Then we
have the following equivalence

\begin{center}
\(\fM_A\) realizes \(\{\gamma(\und{a}_1,\und{a}_2,x)\}\) iff there is a \(b\)
s.t. \(\fM\models\gamma(x_1,x_2,x)[a_1,a_2,b]\)
\end{center}

So a model is \(\alpha\)-saturated iff the following holds for every
\(n<\alpha\) and every set \(\Gamma\) of formulas of the form \(\gamma(x_1,\dots,x_n,x)\)

\begin{center}
\textbf{If} \((a_1,\dots,a_n)\) is an \(n\)-tuple s.t. for every finite
\(\Delta\subseteq\Gamma\) there is a \(b_{\Delta}\) s.t.
\(\fM\models\gamma(x_1,\dots,x_n,x)[a_1,\dots,a_n,b_\Delta]\) for every
\(\gamma\in\Delta\)


\textbf{then} we have that there is a \(b\) s.t.
 \(\fM\models\gamma(x_1,\dots,x_n,x)[a_1,\dots,a_n,b]\) for every \(\gamma\in\Gamma\)
\end{center}


\begin{definition}[]
Let \(\alpha\) be a natural number, or \(\omega\). A model \(\fM\) is \textbf{\(\alpha\)-saturated}
if for  every subset \(A\subseteq W\) of size less than \(\alpha\), the expansion
\(\fM_A\) realizes every set \(\Gamma(x)\) of \(\call^1[A]\)-formulas (with only
\(x\) occurring free) that is \emph{consistent} (a proof-theoretic notion, only
finite deductions, hence this definition is consistent the definition above)
with the first-order theory of
\(\fM_A\). An \(\omega\)-saturated model is usually called \textbf{countably saturated}
\end{definition}

\begin{examplle}[]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Every finite model is countably saturated. For if \(\fM\) is finite, and
\(\Gamma(x)\) is a set of first-order formulas consistent with the first-order
theory of \(\fM\), there exists a model \(\fN\) that is elementarily
equivalent to \(\fM\) and that realizes \(\Gamma(x)\). But as \(\fM\) and
\(\fN\) are finite, elementary equivalence implies isomorphism
(\href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1518629/a-simple-proof-that-elementary-equivalence-and-isomorphism-coincide-for-finite-s}{proof})
, and hence
\(\Gamma(x)\) is realized in \(\fM\)
\item The ordering of the rational numbers \((\Q,<)\) is countably saturated as
well. The relevant first-order language \(\call^1\) has \(<\) and \(=\).
Take a subset \(A\) of \(\Q\) and let \(\Gamma(x)\) be a set of formulas in the
resulting expansion \(\call^1[A]\) of the first-order language that is
consistent with the theory of \((\Q,<,a)_{a\in A}\). Then there exists a
model \(\fN\) of the theory of \((\Q,<,a)_{a\in A}\) that realizes
\(\Gamma(x)\). \(\star\).
Now take a countable elementary submodel \(\fN'\) of \(\fN\) that
contains at least one object realizing \(\Gamma(x)\). Then \(\fN'\) is a
countable dense linear ordering without endpoints, and hence the ordering
of \(\fN'\) is isomorphic to \((\Q,<)\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{examplle}

\begin{theorem}[]
\label{thm2.65}
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type. Any countably saturated \(\tau\)-model is
\(m\)-saturated. It follows that the class of countably saturated
\(\tau\)-models has the Hennessy-Milner property
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Assume that \(\fM=(W,R,V)\) viewed as a first-order model, is countably
saturated. Let \(a\) be a state in \(W\), and consider a set \(\Sigma\) of modal
formulas which is finite satisfiable in the successor set of \(a\). Define
\(\Sigma'\) to be the set
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma'=\{R\und{a}x\}\cup ST_x(\Sigma)
\end{equation*}
where \(ST_x(\Sigma)=\{ST_x(\phi)\mid\phi\in\Sigma\}\). \(\Sigma'\) is consistent
with the first-order theory of \(\fM_a\): \(\fM_a\) realizes every finite
subset of \(\Sigma'\), namely in some successor of \(a\). So by the
countable saturation of \(\fM\), \(\Sigma'\) is realized in some state
\(b\). By \(\fM_A\models R\und{a}x[b]\) it follows that \(b\) is a successor
of \(a\). Then, by Proposition \ref{prop2.47} and the fact that \(\fM_a\models
    ST_x(\phi)[b]\) for all \(\phi\in\Sigma\), it follows that
\(\fM,b\Vdash\Sigma\). Thus \(\Sigma\) is satisfiable in a successor of \(a\)
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Detour Lemma]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, and let \(\fM\) and \(\fN\) be two models,
and \(w\) and \(v\) states in \(\fM\) and \(\fN\), respectively. Then the
following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For all modal formulas \(\phi\): \(\fM,w\Vdash\phi\) iff \(\fN,v\Vdash\phi\)
\item There exists a bisimulation \(Z:\ue\fM,\pi_w\leftrightarroweq\ue\fN,\pi_v\)
\item There exist countably saturated models \(\fM^*,w^*,\fN^*,v^*\) and elementary
embeddings \(f:\fM\preceq\fM^*\) and \(g:\fN\preceq\fN^*\) s.t.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(f(w)=w^*\) and \(g(v)=v^*\)
\item \(\fM^*,w^*\leftrightarroweq\fN^*,v^*\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}[]
A first-order formula \(\alpha(x)\) in \(\call^1_\tau\) is \textbf{invariant for
bisimulations} if for all models \(\fM\) and \(\fN\), and all states \(w\) in
\(\fM\), \(v\) in \(\fN\), and all bisimulations \(Z\) between \(\fM\) and
\(\fN\) s.t. \(wZv\), we have \(\fM\models\alpha(x)[w]\) iff \(\fN\models\alpha(x)[v]\)
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[van Benthem Characterization Theorem]
Let \(\alpha(x)\) be a first-order formula in \(\call_\tau^1\). Then \(\alpha(x)\) is
invariant for bisimulations iff it is equivalent to the standard translation
of a modal \(\tau\)-formula
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Assume \(\alpha(x)\) is invariant for bisimulations and consider the set of modal
consequences of \(\alpha\):
\begin{equation*}
MOC(\alpha)=\{ST_x(\phi)\mid\phi\text{ is a modal formula, and }\alpha(x)\models ST_x(\phi)\}
\end{equation*}
Our first claim is that if \(MOC(\alpha)\models\alpha(x)\), then \(\alpha\) is
equivalent to the translation of a modal formula.  Assume
\(MOC(\alpha)\models\alpha(x)\), then by the Compactness Theorem for first-order
logic, for some finite subset \(X\subseteq MOC(\alpha)\), we have
\(X\models\alpha(x)\). So \(\models\bigwedge X\to\alpha(x)\). Trivially
\(\models\alpha(x)\to\bigwedge X\), thus
\(\models\alpha(x)\leftrightarrow\bigwedge X\). And as every \(\beta\in X\)
is the translation of a modal formula, so is \(\bigwedge X\)

So it suffices to show that \(MOC(\alpha)\models\alpha(x)\). Assume
\(\fM\models
    MOC(\alpha)[w]\); we need to show that \(\fM\models\alpha(x)[w]\). Let
\begin{equation*}
T(x)=\{ST_x(\phi)\mid\fM\models ST_x(\phi)[w]\}
\end{equation*}
We claim that \(T(x)\cup\{\alpha(x)\}\) is consistent. Assume that
\(T(x)\cup\{\alpha(x)\}\) is inconsistent. Then by compactness, for some finite
subset \(T_0(x)\subset T(x)\) we have \(\models\alpha(x)\to\neg\bigwedge
    T_x(x)\). Hence \(\neg\bigwedge T_0(x)\in MOC(\alpha)\). But this implies
\(\fM\models\neg\bigwedge T_0(x)[w]\), a contradiction

Let \(\fN,v\) be s.t. \(\fN\models T(x)\cup\{\alpha(x)\}[v]\). Observe that \(w\)
and \(v\) are modally equivalent: \(\fM,w\Vdash\phi\) implies \(ST_x(\phi)\in
    T(x)\), which implies \(\fN,v\Vdash\phi\); and likewise, if
\(\fM,w\not\Vdash\phi\) then \(\fM,w\Vdash\neg\phi\) and
\(\fN,v\Vdash\neg\phi\).


We can use the Detour Lemma and make a detour through a Hennessy-Milner
class where modal equivalence and bisimilarity do coincide.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
\fM,w\arrow[d,dash,"\preceq"]&\fN,v\arrow[d,dash,"\preceq"]\\
\fM^*,w^*\arrow[r,"\leftrightarroweq",dash]&\fN^*,v^*
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\(\fN\models\alpha(x)[v]\) implies \(\fN^*\models\alpha(x)[v^*]\). As
\(\alpha(x)\) is invariant for bisimulations, we get
\(\fM^*\models\alpha(x)[w^*]\). By invariance under elementary embeddings,
we have \(\fM\models\alpha(x)[w]\)
\end{proof}


\subsubsection{Ultraproducts}
\label{sec:org3cff545}

Suppose \(I\neq\emptyset\), \(U\) is an ultrafilter over \(I\).
\begin{definition}[Ultraproducts of Sets]
Let \(f_U\) be the equivalence class of \(f\) modulo \(\sim_U\), that is:
\(f_U=\{g\in C\mid g\sim_U f\}\). The \textbf{ultraproduct of \(W_i\) modulo} \(U\),
denoted as \(\prod_UW_i\) is the set of all equivalence classes of
\(\sim_U\). So
\begin{equation*}
\prod_UW_i=\{f_U\mid f\in\prod_{i\in I}W_i\}
\end{equation*}
In case \(W_i=W\), the ultraproduct is called the \textbf{ultrapower of \(W\) modulo}
\(U\), and written \(\prod_UW\)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Ultraproduct of Models]
Fix a modal similarity type \(\tau\), and let \(\fM_i(i\in I)\) be \(\tau\)-models.
The \textbf{ultraproduct} \(\prod_U\fM_i\) of \(\fM_i\) modulo \(U\) is the model
described as follows
\begin{enumerate}
\item The universe \(W_U\) of \(\prod_U\fM_i\) is the set \(\prod_UW_i\)
\item Let \(V_i\) be the valuation of \(\fM_i\). Then the valuation \(V_U\) of
\(\prod_U\fM_i\) is defined by
\begin{equation*}
f_U\in V_U(p) \quad\text{ iff }\quad
\{i\in I\mid f(i)\in V_i(p)\}\in U
\end{equation*}
\item Let \(\triangle\) be a modal operator in \(\tau\), and \(R_{\triangle i}\) its
associated relation in the model \(\fM_i\). The relation \(R_{\triangle
       U}\) in \(\prod_U\fM_i\) is given by
\begin{equation*}
R_{\triangle U}f_U^1\dots f_U^{n+1} \quad\text{ iff }\quad
\{i\in I\mid R_{\triangle i}f^1(i)\dots f^{n+1}(i)\}\in U
\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}


In particular,
\begin{equation*}
R_{\diamond U}f_Ug_U \quad\text{ iff }\quad
\{i\in I\mid R_{\diamond i}f(i)g(i)\}\in U
\end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[]
Let \(\prod_U\fM\) be an ultrapower of \(\fM\). Then for al modal formulas \(\phi\)
we have \(\fM,w\Vdash\phi\) iff \(\prod_U\fM,(f_w)_U\Vdash\phi\), where
\(f_w\) is the constant function s.t. \(f_w(i)=w\) for all \(i\in I\)
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\phi=p\)
\begin{align*}
\fM,w\Vdash\phi&\Leftrightarrow w\in V(\phi)\\&\Leftrightarrow
\{i\in I\mid f_w(i)\in V(p)\}=I\in U\\&\Leftrightarrow
\prod_U\fM,(f_w)_U\Vdash\phi
\end{align*}
\item \(\phi=\diamond\psi\)
\begin{equation*}
Rwv\Leftrightarrow\{i\in I\mid R_{\diamond i}f_w(i)f_v(i)\}=I\in U\Leftrightarrow
R_{\diamond U}f_wg_v
\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

An ultrafilter is \textbf{countably incomplete} if it is not closed under countably intersections

\begin{examplle}[]
Consider the set of natural numbers \(\N\). Let \(U\) be an ultrafilter over
\(\N\) that does not contain any singletons \(\{u\}\). Then for all \(n\),
\((\N\setminus\{n\})\in U\). But
\begin{equation*}
\emptyset=\bigcap_{n\in\N}(\N\setminus\{n\})\not\in U
\end{equation*}
So \(U\) is countably incomplete
\end{examplle}

\begin{lemma}[]
\label{lemma2.73}
Let \(\call\) be a countable first-order language, \(U\) a countably
incomplete ultrafilter over a non-empty set \(I\), and \(\fM\) an
\(\call\)-model. The ultrapower \(\prod_U\fM\) is countably saturated
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[]
\label{thm2.74}
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, and let \(\fM\) and \(\fN\) be
\(\tau\)-models, and \(w\) and \(v\) states in \(\fM\) and \(\fN\)
respectively. Then the following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item For all modal formulas \(\phi\): \(\fM,w\Vdash\phi\) iff \(\fN,v\Vdash\phi\)
\item There exists ultrapowers \(\prod_U\fM\) and \(\prod_U\fN\) as well as a
bisimulation \(Z:\prod_U\fM,(f_w)_U\leftrightarroweq\prod_U\fN,(f_v)_U\)
linking \((f_w)_U\) and \((f_v)_U\), where \(f_w(f_v)\) is the constant
function mapping every index to \(w(v)\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\(2\to1\). \(\fM,w\Vdash\phi\) iff \(\prod_U\fM,(f_w)_U\Vdash\phi\) iff
\(\prod_U\fN,(f_v)_U\Vdash\phi\) iff \(\fN,v\Vdash\phi\)

\(1\to2\). Take \(\N\) as our index set, and let \(U\) be a countably
incomplete ultrafilter over \(\N\). By Lemma \ref{lemma2.73} the ultrapowers
\(\prod_U\fM\) and \(\prod_U\fN\) are countably saturated. Now \((f_w)_U\)
and \((f_v)_U\) are modally equivalence. Next apply Theorem \ref{thm2.65}: as
\((f_w)_U\) and \((f_v)_U\) are modally equivalent and \(\prod_U\fM\) and
\(\prod_U\fN\) are countably saturated, there exists a bisimulation
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Definability}
\label{sec:org2fab737}
Given a modal similarity type \(\tau\), a pointed model is a pair \((\fM,w)\) where
\(\fM\) is a \(\tau\)-model and \(w\) is a state of \(\fM\). A class of
pointed models \(\sfK\) is said to be \textbf{closed under bisimulations} if
\((\fM,w)\in\sfK\) and \(\fM,w\leftrightarroweq\fN,v\) implies
\((\fN,v)\in\sfK\). \(\sfK\) is \textbf{closed under ultraproducts} if any
ultraproducts \(\prod_U(\fM_i,w_i)\) of a family of pointed models
\((\fM_i,w_i)\) in \(K\) belongs to \(\sfK\). If \(\sfK\) is a class of
pointed \(\tau\)-models, \(\bbar{\sfK}\) denotes the complement of \(\sfK\)
within the class of all pointed \(\tau\)-models. \(\sfK\) is
\textbf{definable by a set of modal formulas} if there is a set of modal formulas \(\Gamma\)
s.t. for any pointed model \((\fM,w)\) we have \((\fM,w)\) in \(\sfK\) iff
for all \(\gamma\in\Gamma,\fM,w\Vdash\gamma\). \(\sfK\) is definable by a
single modal formula iff it is definable by a singleton set

By Theorem \ref{thm2.20} definable classes of pointed models must be closed
under bisimulations, and by Proposition \ref{prop2.47} and Corollary
\ref{corA.20} they must be closed under ultraproducts as well.

\begin{theorem}[]
\label{thm2.75}
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, and \(\sfK\) a class of pointed
\(\tau\)-models. Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\sfK\) is definable by a set of modal formulas
\item \(\sfK\) is closed under bisimulations and ultraproducts, and
\(\bbar{K}\) is closed under ultrapowers
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Assume \(\sfK\) and \(\bbar{\sfK}\) satisfy the stated closure conditions.
Observe that \(\bbar{\sfK}\) is closed under bisimulations as \(\sfK\) is.
Define
\begin{equation*}
T=\{\phi\mid\forall(\fM,w)\in\sfK:\fM,w\Vdash\phi\}
\end{equation*}
We will show that \(T\) defines the class of \(\sfK\).

Assume \(\fM,w\Vdash T\). Define \(\Sigma=\{\phi\mid\fM,w\Vdash\phi\}\). It is
obvious that \(\Sigma\) is finitely satisfiable in \(\sfK\); for suppose that the set
\(\{\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n\}\subseteq\Sigma\) is not satisfiable in
\(\sfK\). Then the formula \(\neg(\sigma_1\wedge\dots\wedge\sigma_n)\) would
be true on all pointed models in \(\sfK\), so it would belong to \(T\), yet
be false in \(\fM,w\). But then the following claim shows that \(\Sigma\) is
satisfiable in the ultraproduct of pointed models

\textbf{Claim 1} . Let \(\Sigma\) be a set of modal formulas, and \(\sfK\) a class of pointed
 models in which \(\Sigma\) is finitely satisfiable. Then \(\Sigma\) is satisfiable in some
 ultraproduct of models in \(\sfK\)

\emph{Proof of Claim.} Define in index set \(I\) as the collection of all finite
subsets of \(\Sigma\)
\begin{equation*}
I=\{\Sigma_0\subset\Sigma\mid \Sigma_0\text{ is finite}\}
\end{equation*}
By assumption, for each \(i\in I\) there is a pointed model \((\fN_i,v_i)\)
in \(\sfK\) s.t. \(\fN_i,v_i\Vdash i\). We now construct an ultrafilter
\(U\) over \(I\) s.t. the ultraprodcut \(\prod_U\fN_i\) has a state \(f_U\)
with \(\prod_U\fN_i,f_U\Vdash\Sigma\)

For each \(\sigma\in\Sigma\), let \(\widehat{\sigma}\) be the set of all \(i\in
     I\) s.t. \(\sigma\in i\). Then the set
\(E=\{\widehat{\sigma}\mid\sigma\in\Sigma\}\) has the finite intersection
property because
\begin{equation*}
\{\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n\}\in\widehat{\sigma}_1\cap\dots\cap\widehat{\sigma}_n
\end{equation*}
So \(E\) can be extended to an ultrafilter \(U\) over \(I\). This defines
\(\prod_U\fN_i\); for the definition of \(f_U\), let \(W_i\) denote the
universe of the model \(\fN_i\) and consider the function \(f\in\prod_{i\in
     I}W_i\) s.t. \(f(i)=v_i\).
It is left to prove that
\begin{equation*}
\prod_U\fN_i,f_U\Vdash\Sigma
\end{equation*}
Observe that for \(i\in\widehat{\sigma}\) we have \(\sigma\in i\) and so
\(\fN_i,v_i\Vdash\sigma\). Therefore for each \(\sigma\in\Sigma\)
\begin{equation*}
\{i\in I\mid\fN_i,v_i\Vdash\sigma\}\supseteq\widehat{\sigma} \quad\text{ and }\quad
\widehat{\sigma}\in U
\end{equation*}
since \(\sigma\in i\) implies \(\fN_i,v_i\Vdash\sigma\). It follows that
\(\{i\in I\mid\fN_i,v_i\Vdash\sigma\}\in U\), so by Theorem \ref{thmA.19}
\(\prod_U\fN_i,f_U\Vdash\sigma\). Hence \(\prod_U\fN_i,f_U\Vdash\Sigma\)

It follows from Claim 1 and the closure of \(\sfK\) under taking
ultraproducts that \(\Sigma\) is satisfiable in some pointed model
\((\fN,v)\in\sfK\). But \(\fN,v\Vdash\Sigma\) implies that \(v\) and the
state \(w\)  from our \uline{original pointed model \((\fM,w)\) are modally
equivalent}. So by Theorem \ref{thm2.74} there exists an ultrafilter \(U'\)
s.t.
\begin{equation*}
\prod_{U'}(\fN,v),(f_v)_U\leftrightarroweq
\prod_{U'}(\fM,w),(f_w)_U
\end{equation*}
By closure under ultraproducts, the pointed model
\((\prod_{U'}(\fN,v),(f_v)_U)\) belongs to \(\sfK\). Hence by closure under
bisimulations, \((\prod_{U'}(\fM,w),(f_w)_U)\) is in \(\sfK\). By closure
of \(\bbar{K}\) under ultrapowers, \((\fM,w)\in\sfK\)
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[]
\label{thm2.76}
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, and \(\sfK\) a class of pointed
\(\tau\)-models. Then the following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\sfK\) is definable by means of a single modal formula
\item Both \(\sfK\) and \(\bbar{\sfK}\) are closed under bisimulations and ultraproducts
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Assume \(\sfK,\bbar{\sfK}\) satisfy the stated conditions. Then both are
closed under ultraproducts, hence by Theorem \ref{thm2.75} there are set of
modal formulas \(T_1,T_2\) defining \(\sfK\) and \(\bbar{\sfK}\)
respectively. Observe their union is inconsistent in the sense that there is
no pointed model \((\fM,w)\) s.t. \((\fM,w)\Vdash T_1\cup T_2\). So by
compactness there exists \(\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n\in T_1\) and
\(\psi_1,\dots,\psi_m\in T_2\) s.t. for all pointed models \((\fM,w)\)
\begin{equation*}
\fM,w\Vdash\phi_1\wedge\dots\wedge\phi_n\to\neg\psi\vee\dots\vee\neg\psi_m
\end{equation*}
By definition, for any \((\fM,w)\in\sfK\) we have
\(\fM,w\Vdash\phi_1\wedge\dots\wedge\phi_n\). Conversely, if
\(\fM,w\Vdash\phi_1\wedge\dots\wedge\phi_n\), then
\(\fM,w\Vdash\neg\psi_1\vee\dots\vee\neg\psi_m\). Hence \(\fM,w\not\Vdash
    T_2\). Therefore \((\fM,w)\not\in\bbar{\sfK}\), whence \((\fM,w)\in\sfK\)
\end{proof}




\section{Frames}
\label{sec:orgd7d20fb}

\subsection{Frame Definability}
\label{sec:org3caed5b}
\begin{definition}[Validity]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type. A formula \(\phi\) (of this similarity type) is
\textbf{valid at a state \(w\) in a frame \(\fF\)} (notation: \(\fF,w\Vdash\phi\)) if
\(\phi\) is true at \(w\) in every model \((\fF,V)\) based on \(\fF\); \(\phi\) is
\textbf{valid on a frame \(\fF\)} (notation: \(\fF\Vdash\phi\)) if it is valid at
every state in \(\fF\). A formula \(\phi\) is \textbf{valid on a class of frames \(\sfK\)}
(notation: \(\sfK\Vdash\phi\)) if it is valid on every frame \(\fF\) in
\(\sfK\). We denote the class of frames where \(\phi\) is valid by \(\sfFr_\phi\)

A set \(\Gamma\) of modal formulas (of type \(\tau\)) is \textbf{valid on a frame \(\fF\)} if every
formula in \(\Gamma\) is valid on \(\sfF\); and \(\Gamma\) is \textbf{valid on a class \(\sfK\) of
frames} if \(\Gamma\) is valid on every member of \(\sfK\). We denote the class of
frames where \(\Gamma\) is valid by \(\sfFr_\Gamma\)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Definability]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, \(\phi\) a modal formula of this type, and
\(\sfK\) a class of \(\tau\)-frames. We say that \(\phi\) \textbf{defines} (or \textbf{characterizes})
\(\sfK\) if for all frames \(\fF\), \(\fF\) is in \(\sfK\) iff
\(\fF\Vdash\phi\). Similarly, if \(\Gamma\) is a set of modal formulas of this type,
we say that \(\Gamma\) \textbf{defines} \(\fF\) is in \(\sfK\) iff \(\fF\Vdash\Gamma\)

A class of frames is \textbf{(modally) definable} if there is some set of modal
formulas that defines it
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Relative Definability]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, \(\phi\) a modal formula of this type, and
\(\sfC\) a class of \(\tau\)-frames. We say that \(\phi\) \textbf{defines} (or \textbf{characterizes})
a class \(\sfK\) of frames \textbf{within} \(\sfC\) (or \textbf{relative to} \(\sfC\)) if for
all frames \(\fF\) in \(\sfC\) we have that \(\fF\) is in \(\sfK\) iff
\(\fF\Vdash\phi\)

Similarly, if \(\Gamma\) is a set of modal formulas of this type, we say that \(\Gamma\)
\textbf{defines} a class \(\sfK\) of frames \textbf{within} \(\sfC\) if for all frames \(\fF\)
in \(\sfC\) we  have that \(\fF\) is in \(\sfK\) iff \(\fF\Vdash\Gamma\)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Frame Languages]
For any modal similarity type \(\tau\), the \textbf{first-order frame language} of \(\tau\) is the
first-order language that has the identity symbol = together with an
\((n+1)\)-ary relation symbol \(R_{\triangle}\) for each \(n\)-ary modal
operator \(\triangle\) in \(\tau\). We denote this language by \(\call_\tau^1\). We
often call it the \textbf{first-order correspondence language} (for \(\tau\))

Let \(\Phi\) be any set of proposition letters. The \textbf{monadic second-order frame
language} of \(\tau\) over \(\Phi\) is the monadic second-order language obtained by
augmenting \(\call_\tau^1\) with a \(\Phi\)-indexed collection of monadic
predicate variables. (That is, this language has all the resources of
\(\call_\tau^1\), and in addition is capable of quantifying over subsets of
frames). We denote this language by \(\call_\tau^2(\Phi)\). We often simply call it the
\textbf{second-order frame language} or the \textbf{second-order correspondence language} (for \(\tau\))
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Frame Correspondence]
If a class of frames (property) can be defined by a modal formula \(\phi\) and by a
formula \(\alpha\) from one of these frame languages, then we say that \(\phi\) and \(\alpha\) are
each others (global) frame \textbf{correspondents}
\end{definition}

For example the basic modal formula \(p\to\Diamond p\) and the first-order
sentence \(\forall xRxx\) are correspondents

\begin{examplle}[]
Read \(\Diamond\phi\) as 'it is \textbf{possibly} the case that \(\phi\) ' and \(\Box\phi\) as
'\textbf{necessarily} \(\phi\)  '.
\begin{itemize}
\item [(T)] \(p\to\Box p\)
\item [(4)] \(\Diamond\Diamond p\to\Diamond p\)
\item [(5)] \(\Diamond p\to\Box\Diamond p\)
\end{itemize}

Our first claim is that for any frame \(\fF=(W,R)\), the axiom T corresponds
to \textbf{reflexivity} of the relation \(R\):
\begin{equation*}
\fF\Vdash \text{T}\quad\text{ iff }\quad
\fF\Vdash\forall x\;Rxx
\end{equation*}
Suppose that \(R\) is \textbf{not} reflexive. There exists a state \(w\) which is not
accessible from itself. Now the valuation \(V\) has to satisfy two conditions
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(w\in V(p)\)
\item \(\{x\in W\mid Rwx\}\cap V(p)=\emptyset\)
\end{enumerate}


Consider the \textbf{minimal} valuation \(V\) satisfying condition (1), that is, take
\begin{equation*}
V(p)=\{w\}
\end{equation*}
Now let \(v\) be an \(R\)-succesor of \(w\). As \(Rww\) does not hold in
\(\fF\), \(v\) must be distinct from \(w\), so \(v\not\Vdash p\). As \(v\)
was arbitrary, \(w\not\Vdash p\)

Likewise, one can prove that for any frame \(\fF=(W,R)\)
\begin{alignat*}{3}
&\fF\Vdash4&&\quad\text{ iff }\quad&&R\text{ is transitive}\\
&\fF\Vdash5\quad&&\quad\text{ iff }\quad&&
R \text{ is euclidean}
\end{alignat*}
where a relation is \textbf{euclidean} if it satisfies \(\forall xyz((Rxy\wedge
   Rxz)\to Ryz)\).

Assume \(\fF\) is a non-euclidean frame; then there must be states \(u,v,w\)
s.t. \(Ruv,Ruw\) but not \(Rvw\):
\begin{tikzpicture}
[n/.style={circle,fill=black,inner sep=0pt,minimum size=2mm}]
\node[n] (u) at (0,0) {};
\node[n] (v) at (2,1) {};
\node[n] (w) at (2,-1) {};
\node[n] (v') at (3,1) {};
\node[left] at (u.west) {$u$};
\node[right] at (v'.east) {$v'$};
\node[above] at (v.north) {$v$};
\node[right] at (w.east) {$w$};
\draw[->] (u) --(v);
\draw[->](u) --  (w);
\draw[->] (v) -- (v');
\draw[->] (v)--node[strike out,draw,-]{} (w);
\end{tikzpicture}
We will try to falsify 5 in \(u\); for this purpose we have to find a
valuation \(V\) s.t. \((\fF,V),u\Vdash\Diamond p\) and
\((\fF,V),u\not\Vdash\Box\Diamond p\). In other words, we have to make \(p\)
\textbf{true} at some \(R\)-successor \(x\) of \(u\), and \textbf{false} at all
\(R\)-successors of some \(R\)-successor \(y\) of \(u\). The constaints on
\(V\) are
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(w\in V(p)\)
\item \(\{z\mid Rvz\}\cap V(p)=\emptyset\)
\end{enumerate}


Let's take a \textbf{maximal} \(V\) satisfying condition (2), that is, define
\begin{equation*}
V(p)=\{z\in W\mid\text{ it is not the case that }Rvz\}
\end{equation*}
Now \(v\not\Vdash\Diamond p\), so \(u\not\Vdash\Box\Diamond p\). On the other
hand, we have \(w\Vdash p\), so \(u\Vdash\Diamond p\)
\end{examplle}

\begin{examplle}[]
Suppose that we are working with the basic temporal language and that we are
interested in \textbf{dense} bidirectional frames. This property can be defined using
a first-order sentence (namely \(\forall xy(x<y\to\exists z(x<z\wedge
   z<y))\)) but can the basic temporal language define it too?

The following simple formula suffices: \(Fp\to FFp\). Let \(\fT=(T,<)\) be a
frame s.t. \(\fT\Vdash Fp\to FFp\). Suppose that a point \(t\in T\) has a
<-successor \(t'\). Consider the following \textbf{minimal} valuation \(V_m\)
guaranteeing that \((\fT,V_m),t\Vdash Fp\)
\begin{equation*}
V_m(p)=\{t'\}
\end{equation*}
Hence \(t\Vdash FFp\). This means there is a point \(s\) s.t. \(t<s\) and
\(s\Vdash Fp\). But as \(t'\) is the \textbf{only} states where \(p\) holds, this
implies that \(s<t'\)
\end{examplle}

\begin{examplle}[]
Suppose we are working with a similarity type with three binary operators
\(\triangle_1,\triangle_2, \triangle_3\), and that we are interested in the
class of frames in which the three ternary accessibility relations (denoted
by \(R_1,R_2,R_3\) respectively, if \(R_1stu\) and \(s\Vdash p,t\Vdash
   q,s\Vdash r\), then \(s\Vdash q\triangle_1 r\)).

We want
\begin{equation*}
 R_1stu \quad\text{ iff }\quad R_2tus \quad\text{ iff }\quad
 R_3ust
\end{equation*}
to hold for all \(s,t,u\) in such frames. Can we define this class of frames?

We can. We will show that for all frames \(\calf=(W,R_1,R_2,R_3)\) we have
\begin{equation*}
 \calf\Vdash p\wedge(q\triangle_1 r)\to(q\wedge r\triangle_2 p)
 \triangle_1 r
 \quad\text{ iff }\quad \calf\Vdash\forall xyz(R_1xyz\to R_2yzx)
\end{equation*}

Suppose that the modal formula \(p\wedge(q\triangle_1 r)\to(q\wedge
   r\triangle_2 p)\triangle_1 r\) is valid in \(\calf\), and consider states
\(s,t,u\) with \(R_1stu\). Consider a valuation \(V\) with
\(V(p)=\{s\},V(q)=\{t\},V(r)=\{u\}\). Then \((\calf,V),s\Vdash p\wedge
   q\triangle_1 r\), so \(s\Vdash(q\wedge r\triangle_2p)\triangle_1 r\). Hence
there must be states \(t',u'\) with \(R_1st'u'\), \(t'\Vdash q\wedge
   r\triangle_2p\) and \(u'\Vdash r\).
\end{examplle}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex3.1,1}
Consider a language with two diamonds \(\la1\ra\) and \(\la2\ra\). Show that
\(p\to[2]\la1\ra p\)  is valid on precisely those frame for the language

\(p\to[1]\la1\ra p\) define?
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
Define \(V(p)=\{w\}\) to prove left to right.

\(R_1xy\to R_1yx\)
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
Consider a language with three diamonds \(\la1\ra,\la2\ra,\la3\ra\). Show
that the modal formula \(\la3\ra p\leftrightarrow\la1\ra\la2\ra p\) is valid
on a frame for this language iff the frame satisfies the condition \(\forall
   xy(R_3xy\left\rightarrow \exists z(R_1xz\wedge R_2zy))\)
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Frame Definability and Second-Order Logic}
\label{sec:org8f7358c}
\begin{examplle}[]
Consider the Löb formula \(\Box(\Box p\to p)\to \Box p\), which we will call
it \(L\) for brevity. We show that \(L\) defines the class of frames
\((W,R)\) s.t. \(R\) is transitive and \(R\)'s converse is well-founded

We will then show that this is a class of frames that first-order frame
languages \textbf{cannot} define; that is, we will show that this class is not
elementary

Assume that \(\fF=(W,R)\) is a frame with a transitive and conversely
well-founded relation, and then suppose that \(L\) is not valid in \(\fF\).
This means that there is a valuation \(V\) and a state \(w\) s.t.
\((\fF,V),w\not\Vdash\Box(\Box p\to p)\to\Box p\). In other words,
\(w\Vdash\Box(\Box p\to p)\) but \(w\not\Vdash\Box p\). Then \(w\) must have
a successor \(w_1\) s.t. \(w_1\not\Vdash p\), and as \(w_1\Vdash\Box p\to
   p\), we have \(w_1\not\Vdash\Box p\). This in turn implies that \(w_1\) have
a successor \(w_2\) where \(p\) is false; note that by the transitivity of
\(R\), \(w_2\) is also a successor of \(w\). Again, \(w_2\) must have a
\(p\)-falsifying successor \(w_3\) . Hence we find an infinite path
\(wRw_1Rw_2R\dots\) contradicting the converse well-foundedness of \(R\)

For the other direction, assume that either \(R\) is not transitive or its
converse is not well-founded; in both cases we have to find a valuation \(V\)
and a state \(w\) s.t. \((\fF,V),w\not\Vdash L\). Assume that \(R\) is
transitive, but not conversely well-founded. In other words, suppose we have
a transitive frame containing an infinite sequence \(w_0Rw_1Rw_2R\dots\).
Define
\begin{equation*}
V(p)=W\setminus\{x\in W\mid \text{ there is an infinite path starting from }x\}
\end{equation*}
\(\Box p\to p\) is true \textbf{everywhere} in the model, whence certainly,
\((\fF,V),w_0\Vdash\Box(\Box p\to p)\). The claim then follows from the fact
that \((\fF,V),w_0\not\Vdash \Box p\)

Assume that \(R\) is not transitive and its converse is well-founded. Since
\(R\) is not transitive, there is \(Rw_1w_2\) and \(Rw_2w_3\) but \(\neg
   Rw_1w_3\). Let \(V(p)=\{w_2,w_3\}\). Then \((\fF,V),w_1\Vdash\Diamond p\) and
\((\fF,V),w_1\Vdash\neg\Diamond(p\wedge\neg\Diamond p)\)

Finally, to show that the class of frames defined by \(L\) is not elementary,
an easy compactness argument suffices. Suppose for the sake of a
contradiction that there is a first-order formula equivalent to \(L\); call
this formula \(\lambda\). As \(\lambda\) is equivalent to \(L\), and model making \(\lambda\) true must be
transitive. Let \(\sigma_n(x_0,\dots,x_n)\) be the first-order formula
stating that there is an \(R\)-path of length \(n\) through
\(x_0,\dots,x_n\):
\begin{equation*}
\sigma_n(x_0,\dots,x_n)=\bigwedge_{0\le i<n}Rx_ix_{i+1}
\end{equation*}
Every \textbf{finite} subset of
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma=\{\lambda\}\{\forall xyz((Rxy\wedge Ryz)\to Rxz)\}\cup\{\sigma_n\mid n\in\omega\}
\end{equation*}
is satisfiable in a finite linear order, and hence in the class of
transitive, conversely well-founded frames. Thus \(\Sigma\) must have a model. But it
is clear that \(\Sigma\) is \textbf{not} satisfiable in any conversely well-founded frame.
\end{examplle}

\begin{examplle}[]
PDL can be interpreted on any transition system of the form
\(\calf=(W,R_\pi)_{\pi\in\Pi}\). Let's call such a frame \(*\)-\textbf{proper} if the
transition relation \(R_{\pi^*}\) of each program \(\pi^*\) is the reflexive and
transitive closure of the transitive relation \(R_\pi\) of \(\pi\).

Consider the following set of formulas
\begin{equation*}
\Delta=\{[\pi]^*(p\to[\pi]p)\to(p\to[\pi^*]p),
\la\pi^*\ra p\leftrightarrow(p\vee\la \pi\ra\la\pi^*\ra p)\mid\pi\in\Pi\}
\end{equation*}
called \textbf{Segerberg's axiom}, or the \textbf{induction axiom}. We claim that for any
PDL-frame \(\fF\)
\begin{equation*}
\fF\Vdash\Delta \quad\text{ iff }\quad
\fF\text{ is *-proper }
\end{equation*}

A consequences is that PDL is strong enough to define the class of regular
frames. The constraints on the relations interpreting \(\cup\) and ; are
simple first-order conditions, and
\begin{equation*}
\Gamma=\{\la\pi_1;\pi_2\ra p\leftrightarrow\la\pi_1\ra\la\pi_2\ra p,
\la \pi_1\cup\pi_2\ra p\leftrightarrow\la\pi_1\ra p\vee\la\pi_2\ra p\mid\pi\in\Pi\}
\end{equation*}
pins down what is required. So \(\Delta\cup\Gamma\) defines the regular frames
\end{examplle}

We will show that the McKinsey formula (M) \(\Box\Diamond p\to\Diamond\Box

\begin{center}
\emph{View the predicate symbol \(P\) that corresponds to the propostion letter
\(p\)}
\emph{as a monadic second-order variable that we can quantify over}
\end{center}

\begin{proposition}[]
Let \(\tau\) be a modal similarity type, and \(\phi\) a \(\tau\)-formula. Then for any
\(\tau\)-frames and any state \(w\) in \(\fF\)
\begin{alignat*}{3}
&\fF,w\Vdash\phi&\quad\text{ iff }\quad&&\fF\models\forall P_1\dots\forall P_n ST_x(\phi)[w]\\
&\fF\Vdash\phi&\quad\text{ iff }\quad&&\fF\models\forall P_1\dots\forall P_n \forall x\; ST_x(\phi)
\end{alignat*}
Here, the second-order quantifier bind second-order variables \(P_i\)
corresponding to the proposition letters \(p_i\) occurring in \(\phi\)
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let \(\fM=(\fF,V)\) be any model based on \(\fF\)
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex3.2.1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider a modal language with two diamonds \(\la1\ra\) and \(\la2\ra\).
Prove that the class of frames in which \(R_1\) is the reflexive
transitive closure of \(R_2\) is defined by the conjunction of the
formulas \(\la1\ra p\to(p\vee\la1\ra(\neg p\wedge\la2\ra p))\)
and \(\la1\ra p\leftrightarrow(p\vee\la2\ra\la1\ra p)\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Right to left}.
\(p\vee\la2\ra\la1\ra p\to\la1\ra p\) means \(p\to\la1\ra p\) and \(\la2\ra\la1\ra
      p\to\la1\ra p\). Hence the frame must be reflexive.

By reflexivity and \(\la2\ra\la1\ra p\to\la1\ra p\), we can show that
\(R_2xy\to R_1xy\). Consider
\begin{center}\begin{tikzcd}
x\Vdash\neg p\arrow[r,"R_2"]&y\Vdash p\arrow[loop right,"R_1"]
\end{tikzcd}\end{center}
and \(V(p)=\{y\}\)
.Since \(x\Vdash\la2\ra\la1\ra p\), we have \(x\Vdash\la1\ra p\). Hence we
must have \(R_1xy\)

Now suppose
\begin{center}\begin{tikzcd}
x\arrow[r,"R_2"]&y\arrow[r,"R_1"]&z
\end{tikzcd}\end{center}
and \(V(p)=\{z\}\). Since \(x\Vdash\la2\ra\la1\ra p\), we have
\(x\Vdash\la1\ra p\), which means
\begin{center}\begin{tikzcd}
x\arrow[rr,"R_1"]\arrow[rd,"R_2"']&&z\\
&y\arrow[ur,"R_1"']
\end{tikzcd}\end{center}
what's more, \(R_2xy\) implies \(R_1xy\). Hence we have \(R_1xy\wedge
      R_1yz\to R_1xz\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
\end{document}
