\subsection{Completeness and Compactness}
\label{sec:org415ca7b}
\begin{definition}[]
Let \(T\) be a set of sentences of \(\call\) and let \(C\) be a set of
constant symbols of \(\call\). We say that \(C\) is a \textbf{set of witnesses} for
\(T\) iff for every formula \(\varphi\) of \(\call\) with at most one free variable,
say ,\(x\), there is a constant \(c\in C\) s.t.
\begin{equation*}
T\vdash(\exists x)\varphi \to\varphi(c)
\end{equation*}
We say that \(T\) \textbf{has witnesses} in \(\call\) iff \(T\) has some set \(C\) of
witness in \(\call\)
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[]
\label{lemma2.1.1}
Let \(T\) be a consistent set of sentences of \(\call\). Let \(C\) be a set
of new constant symbols of power \(\abs{C}=\norm{\call}\), and let
\(\bbar{\call}=\call\cup C\) be the simple extension of \(\call\) formed by
adding \(C\). Then \(T\) can be extended to a consistent set of sentences
\(\bbar{T}\) in \(\bbar{\call}\) which has \(C\) as a set of witnesses in \(\bbar{\call}\)
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let \(\alpha=\norm{\call}\). For each \(\beta<\alpha\), let \(c_\beta\) be a
constant symbol which does not occur in \(\call\) and s.t. \(\c_\beta\neq
   c_\gamma\) if \(\beta<\gamma<\alpha\). Let \(C=\{c_\beta:\beta<\alpha\}\),
\(\bbar{\call}=\call\cup C\). Clearly \(\norm{\bbar{\call}}=\alpha\), so we
may arrange all formulas of \(\bbar{\call}\) with at most one free variable
in a sequence \(\varphi_\xi,\xi<\alpha\). We now define an increasing sequence
of sets of sentences of \(\bbar{\call}\):
\begin{equation*}
T=T_0\subset T_1\subset\dots\subset T_\xi\subset\dots,\quad\xi<\alpha
\end{equation*}
and a sequence \(d_\xi,\xi<\alpha\) of constants from \(C\) s.t.
\begin{enumerate}
\item each \(T_\xi\) is consistent in \(\bbar{\call}\)
\item if \(\xi=\xi+1\), then \(T_\xi=T_\zeta\cup\{(\exists
      x_\zeta)\varphi_\zeta\to\varphi_\zeta(d_\zeta)\}\); \(\xi_\zeta\) is the
free variable in \(\varphi_\zeta\) if it has one, otherwise \(x_\xi=v_0\)
\end{enumerate}
3.if \(\xi\) is a limit ordinal different from 0, then
\(T_\xi=\bigcup_{\zeta<\xi}T_\zeta\)


Let \(d_\zeta\) be the first element of \(C\) which has not yet occurred in
\(T_\zeta\). We show that
\begin{equation*}
T_{\zeta+1}=T_\zeta\cup\{(\exists x_\zeta)\varphi_\zeta\to\varphi_\zeta(d_\zeta)\}
\end{equation*}
is consistent. If this were not the case, then
\begin{equation*}
   T_\zeta\vdash\neg((\exists x_\zeta)\varphi_\zeta\to\varphi_\zeta(d_\zeta))
\end{equation*}
By propositional logic
\begin{equation*}
T_\zeta\vdash(\exists x_\zeta)\varphi_\zeta\wedge\neg\varphi_\zeta(d_\zeta)
\end{equation*}
As \(d_\zeta\) does not occur in \(T_\zeta\), we have by predicate logic
\begin{gather*}
T_\zeta\vdash(\forall x_\zeta)((\exists x_\zeta)\varphi_\zeta\wedge\neg\varphi_\zeta
(x_\zeta))\\
T_\zeta\vdash(\exists x_\zeta)\varphi_\zeta\wedge\neg(\exists x_\zeta)\varphi_\zeta
\end{gather*}
which contradicts the consistency of \(T_\zeta\). If \(\xi\) is a nonzero limit
ordinal, and each member of the increasing chain \(T_\zeta,\zeta<\xi\) is
consistent, then \(T_\xi\) is consistent.

Now let \(\bbar{T}=\bigcup_{\xi<\alpha}T_\xi\). Suppose \(\varphi\) is a formula of
\(\bbar{\call}\) with at most the variable \(x\) free. Then we may assume
that \(\varphi=\varphi_xi\) and \(x=x_\xi\) for some \(\xi<\alpha\). Whence the
sentence
\begin{equation*}
(\exists x_\xi)\varphi_xi\to\varphi_\xi(d_\xi)
\end{equation*}
belongs to \(T_{\xi+1}\) and so to \(\bbar{T}\)
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[]
\label{lemma2.1.2}
Let \(T\) be a consistent set of sentences and \(C\) be a set of witnesses
for \(T\) in \(\call\). Then \(T\) has a model \(\fA\) s.t. every element of
\(\fA\) is an interpretation of a constant \(c\in C\)
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If a set of sentences \(T\) has a set \(C\) of witnesses in \(\call\), then
\(C\) is also a set of witnesses for every extension of \(T\). Second, if an
extension of \(T\) has a model \(\fA\), then \(fA\) is also a model of \(T\).
So we may assume that \(T\) is maximal consistent in \(\call\)

For two constants \(c,d\in C\), define
\begin{equation*}
c\sim d \quad\text{ iff }\quad
c\equiv d\in T
\end{equation*}
Because \(T\) is maximal consistent, we see that \(\sim\) is an equivalence
relation on \(C\). For each \(c\in C\), let
\begin{equation*}
\widetilde{c}=\{d\in C:d\sim c\}
\end{equation*}
be the equivalence class of \(c\). We propose to construct a model \(\fA\)
whose set of elements \(A\) is the set of all these equivalence classes
\(\widetilde{c}\), for \(c\in C\); so we define
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(A=\{\widetilde{c}:c\in C\}\)
\end{enumerate}



\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item For each \(n\)-placed relation symbol \(P\) in \(\call\), we define an
\(n\)-placed relation \(R'\) on the set \(C\) by: for all \(c_1,\dots,c_n\in
      C\)

\(R'(c_1,\dots, c_n)\) iff \(P(c_1,\dots,c_n)\in T\)

By our axioms of identity, we have

\begin{equation*}
\vdash P(c_1,\dots,c_n)\wedge c_1\equiv d_1\wedge\dots\wedge c_n\equiv d_n\to
P(d_1,\dots,d_n)
\end{equation*}
So \(\sim\) is what is called a \textbf{congruence relation}.
\(R(\widetilde{c}_1,\dots,\widetilde{c}_n)\) iff
\(P(c_1,\dots,c_n)\in T\)
\item Now consider a constant symbol \(d\) of \(\call\). From predicate logic, we
have
\begin{equation*}
\vdash(\exists v_0)(d\equiv v_0)
\end{equation*}
So \((\exists v_0)(d\equiv v_0)\in T\), and because \(T\) has witnesses,
there is a constant \(c\in C\) s.t.
\begin{equation*}
(d\equiv c)\in T
\end{equation*}

the constant \(c\) may not be unique, but its equivalence class is unique
 because
\begin{equation*}
\vdash(d\equiv c\wedge d\equiv c'\to c\equiv c')
\end{equation*}

\item Let \(F\) be any \(m\)-placed function symbol of \(\call\), and let
\(c_1,\dots,c_m\in C\). We have
\begin{equation*}
(\exists v_0)(F(c_1,\dots,c_m)\equiv v_0)\in T
\end{equation*}
hence there is a constant \(c\in C\) s.t.
\begin{equation*}
(F(c_1,\dots ,c_m)\equiv c)\in T
\end{equation*}
We use our axioms of identity to obtain
\begin{equation*}
\vdash (F(c_1\dots c_m)\equiv c\wedge
c_1\equiv d_1\wedge\dots\wedge c_m\equiv d_m\wedge c\equiv d)\to
F(d_1\dots d_m)\equiv d
\end{equation*}
Hence we define

\(G(\widetilde{c}_1\dots\widetilde{c}_m)\) iff
\((F(c_1\dots c_m)\equiv c)\in T\)

By induction
\begin{equation*}
\fA\models t\equiv c \quad\text{ iff }\quad
(t\equiv c)\in T
\end{equation*}
Since \(C\) is a set of witness for \(T\), we have: for any terms
\(t_1,t_2\) of \(\call\) with no free variables
\begin{equation*}
\fA\models t_1\equiv t_2 \quad\text{ iff }\quad
(t_1\equiv t_2)\in T
\end{equation*}

for any atomic formula \(P(t_1\dots t_n)\) of \(\call\) containing no free
variables
\begin{equation*}
\fA\models P(t_1\dots t_n) \quad\text{ iff }\quad
P(t_1\dots t_n)\in T
\end{equation*}

Hence for any sentence \(\varphi\) of \(\call\)
\begin{equation*}
\fA\models\varphi \quad\text{ iff }\quad
\varphi\in T
\end{equation*}

Suppose \(\varphi=(\exists x)\psi\). If \(fA\models\varphi\), then for
some \(\widetilde{c}\in A,\fA\models\psi[\widetilde{c}]\). This means that
\(\fA\models\psi(c)\). So \(\psi(c)\in T\) and because
\begin{equation*}
\vdash\psi(c)\to(\exists x)\psi
\end{equation*}
we have \(\varphi\in T\). On the other hand, if \(\varphi\in T\), then
because \(T\) has witnesses, there exists a constant \(c\in C\) s.t.
\(\psi(c)\in T\), so \(\fA\models\psi(c)\). This gives
\(\fA\models\psi[\widetilde{c}]\) and \(\fA\models\varphi\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[]
\label{lemma2.1.3}
Let \(C\) be a set of constant symbols of \(\call\), and let \(T\) be a
set of sentences of \(\call\). If \(T\) has a model \(\fA\) s.t. every
element of \(\fA\) is an interpretation of some constant \(c\in C\), then
\(T\) can be extended to a consistent \(\bbar{T}\) in \(\call\) for which
\(C\) is a set of witnesses
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let \(\bbar{T}\) be the sentences of \(\call\) true in \(\fA\)
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Extended Completeness Theorem]
   \label{thm1.3.21} 
Let \(\Sigma\) be a set of sentences of \(\call\). Then \(\Sigma\) is consistent iff \(\Sigma\) has a model
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Assume \(\Sigma\) is consistent.  By Lemma \ref{lemma2.1.1} we consider extensions
\(\bbar{\Sigma}\) of \(\Sigma\) and \(\bbar{\call}\) of \(\call\), so that \(\bbar{\Sigma}\) has
witnesses in \(\bbar{\call}\). By Lemma \ref{lemma2.1.2} let \(\fA\) be the
model of \(\bbar{\Sigma}\). Let \(\fB\) be the model for \(\call\) which is the
reduct of \(\fA\) to \(\call\).
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Downward Löwenheim–Skolem Theorem]


Every consistent theory \(T\) in \(\call\) has a model of power at most \(\norm{\call}\)
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Choose \(\fA\) so that every element is a constant.

\(\abs{B}=\abs{A}\le\norm{\bbar{\call}}=\norm{\call}\)
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Gödel's Completeness Theorem]
\label{thm1.3.20}
A sentence of \(\call\) is a theorem of \(\call\) iff it is valid
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
If a sentence \(\sigma\) is not a theorem of \(\call\), then \(\{\neg\sigma\}\) is
consistent in \(\call\). By Theorem \ref{thm1.3.21}, \(\{\neg\sigma\}\) will
have a model where \(\sigma\) cannot hold. Hence \(\sigma\) is not valid
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Compactness Theorem]
\label{thm1.3.22}
A set of sentences \(\Sigma\) has a model iff every finite subset of \(\Sigma\) has a model
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
If every finite subset of \(\Sigma\) has a model, then every finite subset of \(\Sigma\) is
consistent. So \(\Sigma\) is consistent and has a model by Theorem \ref{thm1.3.21}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[]
If a theory \(T\) has arbitrarily large finite models, then it has an
infinite model
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Consider the expansion \(\call'=\call\cup\{c_n:n\in\omega\}\)  where \(c_n\)
is a list of distinct constant symbols not in \(\call\). Consider the set \(\Sigma\)
of \(\call'\) defined by
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma=T\cup\{\neg(c_n\equiv c_m):n<m<\omega\}
\end{equation*}
Any finite subset \(\Sigma'\) of \(\Sigma\) will involve at most the constants
\(c_0,\dots,c_m\) for some \(m\). Let \(\fA\) be  a model of \(T\) with at
least \(m+1\) elements, and let \(a_0,\dots,a_m\) be a list of \(m+1\)
distinct elements of \(\fA\). The model \((\fA,a_0,\dots,a_m)\) for the
finite expansion \(\call''=\call\cup\{c_0,\dots,c_m\}\) of \(\call\) is a
model of (\(\Sigma\)'). So by Theorem \ref{thm1.3.22} \(\Sigma\) has a model.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Upward Löwenheim–Skolem-Tarski Theorem]
If \(T\) has infinite models, then it has infinite models of any given power \(\alpha\ge\norm{\call}\)
\end{corollary}


\textbf{Method of diagrams}. Let \(\fA\) be a model of \(\call\). We expand the
language \(\call\) to a new language
\begin{equation*}
\call_A=\call\cup\{c_a:a\in A\}
\end{equation*}
by If \(a\neq b\) and \(c_a,c_b\) are different symbols, we may then expand
\(\fA\) to the model
\begin{equation*}
\fA_A=(\fA,a)_{a\in A}
\end{equation*}
The \textbf{diagram of} \(\fA\), denote by \(\varlrtriangle_{\fA}\), is the set of all
atomic sentences and negations of atomic sentences of \(\call_A\) which hold
in the model \(\fA_A\)

If \(X\) is a subset of \(A\), then we let \(\call_X=\call\cup\{c_a:a\in
   X\}\) and \(\fA_X=(\fA,a)_{a\in X}\). If \(f\) is a mapping from \(X\) into
the set of elements \(B\) of a model \(\fB\) for \(\call\), then
\((\fB,fa)_{a\in X}\) is the expansion of \(\fB\) to a model for \(\call_X\)

\begin{proposition}[]
\label{prop2.1.8}
Let \(\fA,\fB\) be models for \(\call\) and let \(f:A\to B\). Then the
following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(f\) is an isomorphic embedding of \(\fA\) into \(\fB\)
\item There is an extension \(\fC\supset\fA\) and an isomorphism
\(g:\fC\cong\fB\) s.t. \(g\supset f\)
\item \((\fB,fa)_{a\in A}\) is a model of the diagram of \(\fA\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\(1\to2\). Extend the set \(A\) to a set \(C\) and extend the function \(f\)
to a one-to-one function \(g\) from \(C\) onto \(B\). Then define the
relations
\begin{equation*}
\fC\models R[c_1\dots c_n] \quad\text{ iff }\quad
\fB\models R[gc_1\dots gc_n]
\end{equation*}

\(1\leftrightarrow2\). For each formula \(\varphi(x_1\dots x_n)\) and all
\(a_1,\dots,a_n\in A\)
\begin{equation*}
\fA\models\varphi[a_1\dots a_n] \quad\text{ iff }\quad
\fA_A\models\varphi(a_1\dots a_n)
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
\fB\models\varphi[fa_1\dots fa_n] \quad\text{ iff }\quad
(\fB,fa)_{a\in A}\models\varphi(a_1\dots a_n)
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[]
Suppose that \(\call\) has no function or constant symbols. Let \(T\) be a
theory in \(\call\) and \(\fA\) be a model for \(\call\). Then \(\fA\) is
isomorphically embedded in some model of \(T\) iff every finite submodel of
\(\fA\) is isomorphically embedded in some model of \(T\)
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Suppose every finite submodel of \(\fA\) is isomorphically embedded in some
model of \(T\). We show that the set \(\Sigma=T\cup\varlrtriangle_{\fA}\) is
consistent. Every finite subset \(\Sigma'\) of \(\Sigma\) contains at most a finite
number of the new constants, say \(c_{a_1},\dots,c_{a_m}\). Because the
language \(\call\) has no function or constant symbols, the finite set
\(A'=\{a_1,\dots,a_m\}\) generates a finite submodel \(\fA'\) of \(\fA\). Let
\(\fB'\) be a model of \(T\) where \(\fA'\) is isomorphically embedded. Since
\(\Sigma'\subset\Sigma\), by Proposition \ref{prop2.1.8} \(\fB'\) can be
extended to a model of \(\Sigma'\), and hence \(\Sigma'\) has a model. By
campactness, \(\Sigma\) has a model \(\fB\). By Proposition \ref{prop2.1.8} the reduct
of \(\fB\) to \(\call\) gives a mode lof \(T\)
\end{proof}

\subsection{Refinements of the method. Omitting types and interpolation theorems}
\label{sec:orgca79c4f}
\begin{equation*}
\fA\models\Sigma[a_1\dots a_n]
\end{equation*}
for every \(\sigma\in\Sigma,a_1,\dots,a_n\)satisfies \(\sigma\) in \(\fA\); in this
case we say that \(a_1,\dots,a_n\) \textbf{satisfies}, or \textbf{realizes} \(\Sigma\) in \(\fA\).

\(\fA\) \textbf{realizes} \(\Sigma\) iff some \(n\)-tuple of elements of \(A\) satisfies
\(\Sigma\) in \(\fA\). \(\fA\) \textbf{omits} \(\Sigma\) iff \(\fA\) does not realize \(\Sigma\).
\(\Sigma\) is \textbf{satisfiable in \(\fA\)} iff \(\fA\) realizes \(\Sigma\). \(\Sigma\) is \textbf{consistent} iff its satisfiable

By a \textbf{type} \(\Gamma(x_1\dots x_n)\) in the variables \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) we mean a
maximal consistent set of formulas of \(\call\) in these variables. Given any
model \(\fA\) and \(n\)-tuple \(a_1,\dots,a_n\in A\), the set \(\Gamma(x_1\dots
   x_n)\) of all formulas \(\gamma(x_1\dots x_n)\) satisfied by \(a_1,\dots,a_n\) is
a type and is the unique type realized by \(a_1,\dots,a_n\). It is called the
\textbf{type of} \(a_1,\dots,a_n\) in \(\fA\)

\begin{proposition}[]
Let \(T\) be a theory and let \(\Sigma=\Sigma(x_1\dots x_n)\). The following
are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(T\) has a model which realizes \(\Sigma\)
\item Every finite subset of \(\Sigma\) is realized in some model of \(T\)
\item \(T\cup\{(\exists x_1\dots x_n)(\sigma_1\wedge\dots\wedge
      \sigma_m):m<\omega,\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_m\in\Sigma\}\) is consistent
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

Let \(\Sigma=\Sigma(x_1\dots x_n)\) be a set of formulas of \(\call\). A
theory \(T\) in \(\call\) is said to \textbf{locally realize} \(\Sigma\) iff there is a
formula \(\varphi(x_1\dots x_n)\) in \(\call\) s.t.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\varphi\) is consistent with \(T\)
\item For all \(\sigma\in\Sigma,T\models\varphi\to\sigma\)
\end{enumerate}


That is, every \(n\)-tuple in a model of \(T\) which satisfies \(\varphi\) realizes \(\Sigma\)

\(T\) \textbf{locally omits} \(\Sigma\) iff \(T\) does not locally realize \(\Sigma\). Thus
\(T\) locally omits \(\Sigma\) iff for every formula \(\varphi(x_1\dots x_n)\) which is
consistent with \(T\), there exists \(\sigma\in\Sigma\) s.t.
\(\varphi\wedge\neg\sigma\) is consistent with \(T\)

\begin{proposition}[]
Let \(T\) be a complete theory in \(\call\), and let \(\Sigma=\Sigma(x_1\dots
   x_n)\) be a set of formulas of \(\call\). If \(T\) has a model which omits \(\Sigma\),
then \(T\) locally omits \(\Sigma\)
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
If \(T\) locally realizes \(\Sigma\), then every model of \(T\) realizes \(\Sigma\)
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Omitting Types Theorem]
Let \(T\) be a consistent theory in a countable language \(\call\), and let
\(\Sigma(x_1\dots x_n)\) be a set of formulas. If \(T\) locally omits \(\Sigma\), then
\(T\) has a countable model which omits \(\Sigma\)
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose \(T\) locally omits \(\Sigma(x)\). Let \(C=\{c_0,c_1,\dots\}\) be a
countable set of new constant symbols not already in \(\call\) and let
\(\call'=\call\cup C\). Then \(\call'\) is countable. Arrange all the
sentences of \(\call'\) in a list \(\varphi_0,\varphi_1,\dots\). We shall
construct an increasing sequence of consistent theories
\begin{equation*}
T=T_0\subset T_0\subset\dots\subset T_m\subset\dots
\end{equation*}
s.t.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each \(T_m\) is a consistent theory of \(\call'\) which is a finite
extension of \(T\)
\item Either \(\varphi_m\in T_{m+1}\) or \((\neg\varphi_m)\in T_{m+1}\)
\item If \(\varphi_m=(\exists x)\psi(x)\) and \(\varphi_m\in T_{m+1}\), then
\(\psi(c_p)\in T_{m+1}\) where \(c_p\) is the first constant not occuring in
\(T_m\) or \(\varphi_m\)
\item There is a formula \(\sigma(x)\in\Sigma(x)\) s.t. \((\neg\sigma(c_m))\in
      T_{m+1}\)
\end{enumerate}


Assuming we already have the theory \(T_m\), we construct \(T_{m+1}\) as
follows: Let \(T_m=T\cup\{\theta_1,\dots,\theta_r\},r>0\) and let
\(\theta=\theta_1\wedge\dots\wedge\theta_r\) . Let \(c_0,\dots,c_n\) contain
all the constants from \(C\) occuring in \(\theta\). For the formula \(\theta(x_m)\) of
\(\call\) by replacing each constant \(c_i\) by \(x_i\)(renaming bound
variables if necessary) and prefixing by \(\exists x_i,i\not\equiv m\). Then
\(\theta(x_m)\) is consistent with \(T\). Therefore for some \(\sigma(x)\in\Sigma(x)\),
\(\theta(x_m)\wedge\neg\sigma(x_m)\) is consistent with \(T\). Put the sentence
\(\neg\sigma(c_m)\) into \(T_{m+1}\). This makes (4) hold

If \(\varphi_m\) is consistent with \(T_m\cup\{\neg\sigma(c_m)\}\), put
\(\varphi_m\) into \(T_{m+1}\). Otherwise put \((\neg\varphi_m)\) into
\(T_{m+1}\). This take care of (2). If \(\varphi_m=(\exists x)\psi(x)\) is
consistent with \(T_m\cup\{\neg(\sigma(c_m))\}\), put \(\psi(c_p)\) into \(T_{m+1}\).
This take care of (3). The theory \(T_{m+1}\) is a consistent finite
extension of \(T_m\). Thus (1) - (4) hold for \(T_{m+1}\)

Let \(T_\omega=\bigcup_{n<\omega}T_n\). From (1) and (2) we see that \(T_\omega\)
is a maximal consistent theory in \(\call'\). Let
\(\fB'=(\fB,b_0,b_1,\dots)\) be a countable model of \(T_\omega\), and let
\(\fA'=(\fA,b_0,b_1,\dots)\) be the submodel of \(\fB'\) generated by the
constants \(b_0,b_1,\dots\) We then see from (3) that
\begin{equation*}
A=\{b_0,b_1,\dots\}
\end{equation*}
Moreover, using (3) and the completeness of \(T_\omega\), we can show by
induction on the complexity of a sentence \(\varphi\) in \(\call'\) that
\begin{equation*}
\fA'\models\varphi,\quad\fB'\models\varphi,\quad T_\omega\models\varphi
\end{equation*}
are all equivalent. Thus \(\fA'\) is a model of \(T_\omega\) and hence
\(\fA\) is a model of \(T\). Finally condition (4) ensures that \(\fA\) omits \(\Sigma\)
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[]
Let \(\call\) be countable. A theory \(T\) has a (countable) model omitting
\(\Sigma(x_1\dots x_n)\) iff some complete extension of \(T\) locally omits
\(\Sigma(x_1\dots x_n)\)
\end{corollary}

\begin{examplle}[]
Consider the language \(\call=\{+,\cdot,S,0\}\). We abbreviate
\(1=S0,2=SS0,3=SSS0,\dots\). By an \textbf{\(\omega\)-model} we mean a model \(\fA\)
in which
\begin{equation*}
A=\{0,1,2,3,\dots\}
\end{equation*}
that is, \(\fA\) omits the set \(\{x\not\equiv0,x\not\equiv1,\dots\}\). A
theory \(T\) in \(\call\) is said to be \textbf{\(\omega\)-consistent} iff there is no
formula \(\varphi(x)\) of \(\call\) s.t.
\begin{equation*}
T\models\varphi(0),\quad T\models\varphi(1),\quad T\models\varphi(2),\dots
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
T\models(\exists x)\neg\varphi(x)
\end{equation*}
\(T\) is said to be \textbf{\(\omega\)-complete} iff for every formula \(\varphi(x)\) of
\(\call\) we have

If follows from the omitting types theorem that
\begin{proposition}[]
Let \(T\) be a consistent theory in \(\call\)
\begin{enumerate}
\item If \(T\) is \(\omega\)-complete, then \(T\) has an \(\omega\)-model
\item If \(T\) has an \(\omega\)-model, then \(T\) is \(\omega\)-consistent
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We show that \(T\) locally omits the set
\(\Sigma(x)=\{x\not\equiv0,x\not\equiv1,\dots\}\). Suppose \(\theta(x)\) is
consistent with \(T\). Then \(T\models(\forall x)\neg\theta(x)\) fails. By
\(\omega\)-completeness, there is a \(n\) s.t. not
\(T\models\neg\theta(n)\). Hence \(\theta(n)\) is consistent with \(T\), so
\(\theta(x)\wedge\neg x\not\equiv n\) is consistent with \(T\). Thus \(T\)
locally omits \(\Sigma(x)\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

The \textbf{\(\omega\)-rule} is the following infinite rule of proof: From
\(\varphi(0),\varphi(1),\dots\) infer \((\forall x)\varphi(x)\), where \(\varphi(x)\) is any formula
of \(\call\). \textbf{\(\omega\)-logic} is formed by adding the \(\omega\)-rule to the
axioms and rules of inference of the first-order logic \(\call\) and allowing
infinitely long proofs. We have the following completeness theorem for
\(\omega\)-logic

\begin{proposition}[$\omega$-Completeness Theorem]
A theory \(T\) in \(\call\) is consistent in \(\omega\)-logic iff \(T\) has
an \(\omega\)-model
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let \(T'\) be the set of all sentences of \(\call\) provable from \(T\) in
\(\omega\)-logic. Then \(T\) is consistent in \(\omega\)-logic iff \(T'\) is
consistent in \(\call\). Moreover, \(T'\) is \(\omega\)-complete. Therefore
\(T'\) has an \(\omega\)-model iff \(T'\) is consistent
\end{proof}

\begin{examplle}[Continue]
Let \(\call'\) be a countable language which has among its
symbols a special unary relation symbol \(N\) and special constant symbols
\(0,1,2,\dots\).
By an \textbf{\(\omega\)-model} for \(\call'\) we mean a model \(\fA\) for \(\call'\)
in which \(N\) is interpreted by the set \(\omega\) of natural numbers, and
\(0,1,2,\dots\) are interpreted by themselves. In an \(\omega\)-model, \(\omega\) is a
subset of the universe \(A\), but we allow \(A\) to contain elements outside
of \(\omega\) or even to be uncountable

Let \(T_N\) be the special set of sentences
\begin{equation*}
T_N=\{N(m):m<\omega\}\cup\{\neg m\equiv n:m<n<\omega\}
\end{equation*}
which state that the natural numbers are distinct and belong to \(N\).
\(T_N\) holds in every \(\omega\)-model for \(\call'\). A theory \(T\) in
\(\call'\) is said to be \textbf{\(\omega\)-consistent} iff there is no formula
\(\varphi(x)\) of \(\call'\) s.t.
\begin{equation*}
T_N\cup T\models\varphi(0),T_N\cup T\models\varphi(1),
T_N\cup T\models\varphi(2),\dots
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
T_N\cup T\models(\exists x)(N(x)\wedge\neg\varphi(x))
\end{equation*}
\(T\) is said to be \textbf{\(\omega\)-complete} iff for every formula \(\varphi(x)\) of
\(\call'\) we have
\begin{equation*}
T_N\cup T\models\varphi(0),T_N\cup T\models\varphi(1),T_N\cup T\models\varphi(2),\dots
\end{equation*}
implies
\begin{equation*}
T_N\cup T\models(\forall x)(N(x)\to\varphi(x))
\end{equation*}
The \textbf{\(\omega\)-rule} for \(\call'\) is the infinite rule: From
\(\varphi(0),\varphi(1),\varphi(2),\dots\) infer \((\forall x)(N(x)\to\varphi(x))\). By
\textbf{generalized \(\omega\)-logic} we mean first order logic for the language
\(\call'\) with \(T_N\) added as an additional set of logical axioms and the
\(\omega\)-rule added as an additional rule of proof
\end{examplle}

\begin{proposition}[]
Let \(T\) be a theory in \(\call'\) s.t. \(T_N\cup T\) is consistent
\begin{enumerate}
\item If \(T\) is \(\omega\)-complete, then \(T\) has an \(\omega\)-model
\item If \(T\) has an \(\omega\)-model, then \(T\) is \(\omega\)-consistent

\begin{proposition}[]
A theory \(T\) in \(\call'\) is consistent in generalized \(\omega\)-logic

\begin{theorem}[Extended Omitting Types Theorem]
Let \(T\) be a consistent theory in a countable language \(\call\), and for
each \(r<\omega\) let \(\Sigma_r(x_1,\dots,x_{n_r})\) be a set of formulas in
\(n_r\) variables. If \(T\) locally omits each \(\Sigma_r\), then \(T\) has a
countable model which omits each \(\Sigma_r\)
\end{theorem}

Let's consider the theory ZF, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. A model \(\fB=\la
   B,F\ra\) of ZF is said to be an \textbf{end extension} of a model \(\fA=\la A,E\ra\)
of ZF iff \(\fB\) is a proper extension of \(\fA\) and no member of \(A\)
gets a new element, that is
\begin{equation*}
\text{if }\quad a\in A \quad\text{ and }\quad
b\in B,\quad\text{then }\quad bFa\quad\text{implies}\quad b\in A
\end{equation*}

\begin{theorem}[]
Every countable model \(\fA=\la A,E\ra\) of ZF has an end elementary extension
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let \(\call\) be the language with the symbol \(\in\), a constant symbol
\(\bbar{a}\) for each \(a\in A\), and a new constant symbol \(c\). Let
\(T\) be the theory with the axioms
\begin{gather*}
   \Th((\fA,a)_{a\in A})\\
   c\not\in\bbar{a}, \quad\text{where }a\in A
\end{gather*}
\(T\) is consistent because every finite subset of \(T\) has a model of the
form \((\fA,a,c)_{a\in A}\). For each \(a\in A\), let \(\Sigma_a(x)\) be the
set of formulas
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma_a(x)=\{x\in\bbar{a}\}\cup\{x\not\equiv\bbar{b}:bEa\}
\end{equation*}
It suffices to show that \(T\) locally omits each set \(\Sigma_a(x)\). For
then \(T\) has a model \((\fB,a,c)_{a\in A}\) which omits each
\(\Sigma_a(x)\). We may also assume that \(A\subset B\). \(\fB\) is an
elementary extension of \(\fA\) because \(\Th((\fA,a)_{a\in A})\subset T\),
whence \((\fA,a)_{a\in A}\equiv(\fB,a)_{a\in A}\). \(\fB\) is a proper
extension because \(c\in B\setminus A\). Finally \(\fB\) is an end extension
because it omits each \(\Sigma_a(x)\)

A formula \(\varphi(x,c)\) of \(\call\) is consistent with \(T\) iff
\begin{equation*}
(\fA,a)_{a\in A}\models(\forall y)(\exists z)(\exists x)[z\not\in y\wedge\varphi(x,z)]
\end{equation*}
Suppose \(\varphi(x,c)\) is consistent with \(T\), but \(\varphi(x,c)\wedge\neg
   x\in\bbar{a}\) is not. Then \(\varphi(x,c)\wedge x\in\bbar{a}\) is  consistent with
\(T\). Using the axiom of replacement in ZF, we see in turn that the
following sentences hold in \((\fA,a)_{a\in A}\)
\begin{gather*}
(\forall y)(\exists z)(\exists x)[z\not\in y\wedge\varphi(x,z)\wedge x\in\bbar{a}]\\
(\exists x)(\forall y)(\exists z)[z\not\in y\wedge\varphi(x,z)\wedge x\in\bbar{a}]
\end{gather*}
Then for some \(b\in A\), \(\varphi(\bbar{b},c)\wedge\bbar{b}\in\bbar{a}\) is
consistent with \(T\), whence \(\varphi(x,c)\wedge x\equiv\bbar{b}\) is consistent
with \(T\). Thus \(T\) locally omits \(\Sigma_a(x)\)
\end{proof}

The omitting types theorem is false for uncountable languages. For example,
let \(T\) be the theory with the axioms
\begin{equation*}
c_\alpha\neq c_\beta,\alpha<\beta<\omega_1
\end{equation*}
in the language \(\call\) with constants
\begin{equation*}
\{c_\alpha:\alpha<\omega_1\}\cup\{d_n:n<\omega\}
\end{equation*}
Let \(\Gamma(x)\) be the set of formulas
\begin{equation*}
\Gamma(x)=\{x\not\equiv d_n:n<\omega\}
\end{equation*}
Then \(T\) locally omits \(\Gamma(x)\). However no model of \(T\) omits \(\Gamma(x)\)
because every model of \(T\) is uncountable but each model which omits
\(\Gamma(x)\) is countable

Let \(T\) be a theory and \(\Sigma(x_1\dots x_n)\) a set of formulas in a language
\(\call\) of power \(\alpha\). We say that \(T\) \textbf{\(\alpha\)-realizes} \(\Sigma\) iff there
is a set \(\Phi(x_1\dots x_n)\) of fewer than \(\alpha\) formulas of \(\call\) s.t.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\Phi\) is consistent with \(T\)
\item \(T\cup\Phi(x_1\dots x_n)\models\Sigma(x_1\dots x_n)\)
\end{enumerate}


that is, in any model \(\fA\) of \(T\), any \(n\)-tuple which realizes \(\Phi\)
realizes \(\Sigma\).
Note that if \(\Sigma\) has power less than \(\alpha\), then \(T\) \(\alpha\)-realizes \(\Sigma\) trivially.

\begin{theorem}[$\alpha$-Omitting Types Theorem]
Let \(T\) be a consistent theory in a language \(\call\) of power \(\alpha\) and let
\(\Sigma(x_1\dots x_n)\) be a set of formulas of \(\call\). If \(T\)
\(\alpha\)-omits \(\Sigma\), then \(T\) has a model of power \(\le\alpha\) which omits \(\Sigma\)
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Craig Interpolation Theorem]
Let \(\varphi\),\(\psi\) be sentences s.t. \(\varphi\models\psi\). Then there exists a
sentence \(\theta\) s.t.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\varphi\models\theta\) and \(\theta\models\psi\)
\item Every relation, function or constant symbol (excluding identity) which
occurs in \(\theta\) also occurs in both \(\varphi\) and \(\psi\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

The sentence \(\theta\) will be called a \textbf{Craig interpolation} of \(\varphi\), \(\psi\).

\begin{examplle}[]
In each of the following, \(\varphi\) and \(\psi\) are sentences s.t. the identity symbol
occurs in at most one of them, and \(\varphi\models\psi\); however, \(\varphi\), \(\psi\) have
no Craig interpolation in which the identity symbol does not occur
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\varphi=(\exists x)(P(x)\wedge\neg P(x))\),\(\psi=(\exists x)Q(x)\)
\item \(\varphi=(\exists x)Q(x)\),\(\psi=(\exists x)(P(x)\vee\neg P(x))\)
\item \(\varphi=(\forall xy)(x\equiv y)\),\(\psi=(\forall
      xy)(P(x)\leftrightarrow P(y))\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{examplle}

\begin{proof}
We assume that there is no Craig interpolant \(\theta\) of \(\varphi\) and \(\psi\), and prove that it
is note the case that \(\varphi\models\psi\). To do this we construct a model
of \(\varphi\wedge\neg\psi\). We may assume without loss of generality that
\(\call\) is the language of all symbols which occur in either \(\varphi\) or \(\psi\) or
both.
Let \(\call_1\) be the language of all symbols of \(\varphi\), \(\call_2\) be the
language of all symbols of \(\psi\), and \(\call_0\) the language of all symbols
occurring in both \(\varphi\) and \(\psi\). Thus
\begin{equation*}
\call_1\cap\call_2=\call_0,\quad
\call_1\cup\call_2=\call
\end{equation*}
Form an expansion \(\call'\) of \(\call\) by adding a countable set \(C\) of
new constant symbols and let
\begin{equation*}
\call_0'=\call_0\cup C,\quad
\call_1'=\call_1\cup C,\quad
\call_2'=\call_2\cup C
\end{equation*}

Consider a pair of theories \(T\) in \(\call_1'\) and \(U\) in \(\call_2'\).
A sentence \(\theta\) of \(\call_0'\) is said to \textbf{separate} \(T\) and \(U\) iff
\begin{equation*}
T\models\theta \quad\text{ and }\quad
U\models\neg\theta
\end{equation*}
\(T\) and \(U\) are said to be \textbf{inseparable} iff no sentence \(\theta\) of \(\call_0'\)
separates them.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\{\varphi\}\) and \(\{\neg\psi\}\) are inseparable
\end{enumerate}


For if \(\theta(c_1,\dots,c_n)\) separates \(\{\varphi\}\) and \(\{\neg\psi\}\)
and \(u_1,\dots,u_n\) are variables not occurring in \(\theta(c_1,\dots,c_n)\),
then \((\forall u_1\dots u_n)\theta(u_1\dots u_n)\) is a Craig interpolant of \(\varphi\)
and \(\psi\), contrary to our assumption

Now let
\begin{equation*}
\varphi_0,\varphi_1,\dots,\psi_0,\psi_1,\dots
\end{equation*}
be enumerations of all sentences of \(\call_1'\) and of \(\call_2'\)
respectively. We shall construct two increasing sequences of theories,
\begin{align*}
\{\varphi\}&=T_0\subset T_1\subset\dots,\\
\{\neg\psi\}&=U_0\subset U_1\subset\dots
\end{align*}
in \(\call_1'\) and \(\call_2'\), respectively, s.t.
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item \(T_m\) and \(U_m\) are inseparable finite sets of sentences
\item If \(U_m\cup\{\varphi_m\}\) and \(U_m\) are inseparable, then
\(\varphi_m\in T_{m+1}\)

If \(T_{m+1}\) and \(U_m\cup\{\psi_m\}\) are inseparable, then \(\psi_m\in
      U_{m+1}\)
\item If \(\varphi_m=(\exists x)\sigma(x)\) and \(\varphi_m\in T_{m+1}\), then
\(\sigma(c)\in T_{m+1}\) for some \(c\in C\)

If \(\psi(m)=(\exists x)\delta(x)\) and \(\psi_m\in U_{m+1}\), then \(\delta(d)\in
      U_{m+1}\) for some \(d\in C\)
\end{enumerate}


Given \(T_m\) and \(U_m\), the theories \(T_{m+1}\) and \(U_{m+1}\) are
constructed in the obvious way. For (4), use constants \(c\) and \(d\) which
do not occur in \(T_m,U_m,\varphi_m,\psi_m\). Then inseparability will be
preserved. Let
\begin{equation*}
T_\omega=\bigcup_{m<\omega}T_m,\quad
U_\omega=\bigcup_{m<\omega}U_m
\end{equation*}
Then \(T_\omega\) and \(U_\omega\) are inseparable. It follows that
\(T_\omega\) and \(U_\omega\) are each consistent. We must show that
\(T_\omega\cup U_\omega\) is consistent. We show first that
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\item \(T_\omega\) is a maximal consistent theory in \(\call_1'\) and
\(U_\omega\) is a maximal consistent theory  in \(\call_2'\).
\end{enumerate}


Suppose \(\varphi_m\not\in T_\omega\) and \((\neg\varphi_m)\not\in
   T_\omega\). Since
\(T_m\cup\{\varphi_m\}\) is separable from \(U_m\), there exists
\(\theta\in\call_0'\) s.t.
\begin{equation*}
T_\omega\models\varphi_m\to\theta,\quad
U_\omega\models\neg\theta
\end{equation*}
Also there exists \(\theta'\in\call_0'\) s.t.
\begin{equation*}
T_\omega\models\neg\varphi_m\to\theta',\quad
U_\omega\models\neg\theta'
\end{equation*}
But then
\begin{equation*}
T_\omega\models\theta\vee\theta',\quad
U_\omega\models\neg(\theta\vee\theta')
\end{equation*}
contradicting the inseparability of \(T_\omega\) and \(U_\omega\).
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\item \(T_\omega\cap U_\omega\) is a maximal consistent theory in
\(\call_0'\)
\end{enumerate}


Let \(\sigma\) be a sentence of \(\call_0'\). By (5), either \(\sigma\in T_\omega\) or
\((\neg\sigma)\in T_\omega\) and either \(\sigma\in U_\omega\) or
\((\neg\sigma)\in U_\omega\). Therefore either \(T_\omega\cap
   U_\omega\models\sigma\)
or \(T_\omega\cap U_\omega\models\neg\sigma\)

Let \(\fB_1'=(\fB_1,b_0,b_1,\dots)\) be a model of \(T_\omega\). Using (4)
and (5) we  see that the submodel \(\fA_1' = (\fA_1,b_0,b_1,\dots)\) with
universe \(A_1=\{b_0,b_1,\dots\}\)is also a model of \(T_\omega\). Similarly
\(U_\omega\) has a model \(\fA_2'=(\fA_2,d_0,d_1,\dots)\) with universe \(A_2
   =\{d_0,d_1,\dots\}\).
By (6), the \(\call_0'\) reducts of \(\fA_1'\) and \(\fA_2'\) are isomorphic,
with \(b_n\) corresponding to \(d_n\). We may therefore take \(b_n=d_n\) for
each \(n\), where \(\fA_1,\fA_2\) have the same \(\call_0\) reduct. Let
\(\fA\) be the model for \(\call\) with \(\call_1\) reduct \(\fA_1\) and
\(\call_2\) reduct \(\fA_2\). Since \(\varphi\in T_\omega\) and
\((\neg\psi)\in U_\omega\), \(\fA\) is a model of \(\varphi\wedge\neg\psi\)
\end{proof}

Let \(P\) and \(P'\) be two new \(n\)-placed relation symbols not in the
language \(\call\). Let \(\Sigma(P)\) be a set of sentences of the language
\(\call\cup\{P\}\), and let \(\Sigma(P')\) be the corresponding set of sentences
\(\call\cup\{P'\}\) formed by replacing \(P\) everywhere by \(P'\). We say
that \(\Sigma(P)\) \textbf{defines \(P\) implicitly} iff
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma(P)\cup\Sigma(P')\models(\forall x_1\dots x_n)[P(x_1\dots x_n)\leftrightarrow P'(x_1\dots x_n)]
\end{equation*}
Equivalently, if \((\fA,R)\) and \((\fA,R')\) are models of \(\Sigma(P)\), then
\(R=R'\), \(\Sigma(P)\) is said to \textbf{define \(P\) explicitly} iff there exists a
formula \(\varphi(x_1\dots x_n)\) of \(\call\) s.t.
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma(P)\models(\forall x_1\dots x_n)[P(x_1\dots x_n)\leftrightarrow \varphi(x_1\dots x_n)]
\end{equation*}
If \(\Sigma(P)\) defines \(P\) explicitly, then \(\Sigma(P)\) defines \(P\) implicitly.
Thus, to show that \(\Sigma(P)\) does not define \(P\) explicitly, it suffices to
find two model \((\fA,R)\) and \(\fA,R'\) of \(\Sigma(P)\), with the same reduct
\(\fA\) to \(\call\) s.t. \(R\neq R'\). This is \textbf{Padoa's method}

\begin{theorem}[Beth's Theorem]
\(\Sigma(P)\) defines \(P\) implicitly iff \(\Sigma(P)\) defines \(P\) explicitly
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that \(\Sigma(P)\) defines \(P\) implicitly. Add new constants
\(c_1,\dots,c_n\) to \(\call\). Then
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma(P)\cup\Sigma(P')\models P(c_1\dots c_n)\to P'(c_1\dots c_n)
\end{equation*}
\uline{By the compactness theorem, there exists finite subsets}
\uline{\(\Delta\subset\Sigma(P),\Delta'\subset\Sigma(P')\) s.t.}
\begin{equation*}
\Delta\subset\Delta'\models P(c_1\dots c_n)\to P'(c_1\dots c_n)
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}
